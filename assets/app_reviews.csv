"I have enjoyed the reading articles on the previous version of this app. Now, I can't access it, I've tried using Google and my gmail address unsuccessfully. It's rather frustrating",0
"Useless and frustrating . Forces you to sign up or download app to read the article. When you do, you enjoy it only for this day. Every time I come across an article and ipe the all to read it forces you to subscribe by paying.",0
"The new ux is very weird. I always have the same posts. It seems that I only have around 10 suggested new articles per day to read. It is very hard to search new interesting articles, or search by interest topic. I cannot follow someone when i am reading an article. I have to leave the article , go to his/her profile click on ""follow"".",0
"The whole UI is really bad and weird, previous one was very clean and minimal even the app logo is trash.The UI take more loading time even on good 4G connection and using it feels complex.",0
"Subscribed again but it still does not open even after upgrading. Every time I try to open an article, it tells me to upgrade my subscription. Now, that's horrible! What's the point in subscribing if it does not open up. Something is wrong with the Medium app. Hope it gets rectified soon.",0
The app is less useful than just using the website and also is more confusing to use. It's better off just saving space on my phone.,0
"1 - Audio tab keeps on loading and doesn't open. 2 - When I choose ""search"" then choose any topic, it keeps loading and doesn't open. 3 - The website is not working in Egypt, my ISP made sure that there's no problem from their end. I pinged the site from the cmd with no loss. 4 - I contacted your customer service months ago, they told me they would look into it and I didn't get any follow-up until now. Your app is great. It deserves five stars. Only if I can use it.",0
Apparently 'Read more... ' option is not working. So I can just read first couple of lines ONLY.,0
Editing story and reading interface is not user friendly compared to Quora and Wiki Yahoo Answers. You cannot even login and edit via a mobile browser dunno if desktop browser will work,0
"After attempting to log in via the link with the e-mail verification, it took me back to the send verification link. I attempted to use that e-mail verificationto log in several times. Immediately after I got the emailed verification link I clicked the link and I was never able to login. I uninstalled the app.",0
I can't create an account. The link keeps saying my email has expired when i try to verify my email address. But I'm clicking the email less than a minute after its received. Then it offers to resend the email. I have done this loop 3 times now.,0
"It needed me to sign first so that it can tell me that I have to subscribe. If I knew I had to pay to read an article it sent me in an email wouldn't have bothered with signing in first. This is just spam, sending me content in email I can't read.",0
My story is not showing up on medium. When I try to edit the story it throws 500 error. I spent my half day to write the story and now it's vanished. I can not even back it up. Please do something medium.,0
"I only signed up to leave a comment. I figured I would check you guys out and maybe start a trial so I could eventually get the subscription and pay you guys, but I can't figure out how to leave a comment on a story!?! How frustrating to take so may steps just to leave a comment and then not allow me to do the one thing I came for! How do I comment on a story from the app?????? I'll change rating! I'm really want to know!",0
"It was my go to app but now with everything behind paywall , the only thing which I can read without hassle is my own articles and profile . It's a shame that an app with so much potential and clean interface became so heavily commercialised. They could have made some ad driven model",0
I love the app. Don't get me wrong. It's very helpful. But it doesn't let you read whatever you want! You get 4 stories free then you NEED to go premium. It's not worth it. You shouldnt have to pay. Please fix this. :(,0
I joined the new beta testing version and the app won't even show me a home page anymore. And there are no instructions to switch back to the old version so I'm going to have to uninstall it. It's useless if I can't use it to read stories.,0
"I had planned on blogging on Medium, but when I noticed that I can only read a few articles for free, before Medium asks me to pay to read articles, I decided that no one is going to be willing to pay to read blogs written by an author that they have not yet heard of. I will be deleting my account and uninstalling.",0
"I really wish that they didn't have a 3 story limit for a whole month. It's like dangit, don't yall realize people can replace an app/website so fast with one that's not limiting their reading/writing?..",0
"A horrendous playground for dozens of different typefaces and sizes, that's the exact opposite of an app optimized for reading",0
"""NOT WORKING!"" - When I sign up thru DB, Google, or just an account. It's not working!",0
"Wow, just 3 articles into it and then starts your free trial. I mean like what even is this app about . Do not install this app it is useless, you can't read more than 3 stories , after that you are not allowed to read . And they start begging you for premium account",0
"I am a member and my app keeps crashing, and somehow my music app also gets closed when Medium crashes. Please fix it asap.",0
"App keeps crashing. Was fond of the app experience, however the consistent crashes really is appalling.😖",0
"I was honestly surprised and disappointed at the fact that it's getting paywalled, I just hope this doesn't happen to the website itself but such a shame that this is what's happening to the app.",0
Such a good app but the subscription sucks!! I don't think it's worth subscribing for that amount.,0
"No more great application, it's now fully comercial one. Time to switch to different application.",0
"Worst login mechanisms to app, every time I tried to login shows message link expired with in few seconds.",0
Unable to buy the subscription. It is showing that your card is unavailable for this purchase.,0
Yet another app that I can't even look at without creating an account. Bah. Uninstalling.,0
"This was a good app before. And now you need to pay to read stories. Quit using this app. In the world of free app and sites, you guys want to pay us for this? A BIG NO.",0
I was literally forced to download this app despite preferring to read in the browser. Using the app should be optional.,0
"Used to be my go-to app for reading intresting articles, but now every article on my home page is members only article. What's the point of having a free app when all the content is locked?",0
Cannot sort by new. WFT. I just want to see new cryptocurrency articles but cant figuire out how.,0
Too much crash latest version unable to read block,0
I paid but it still keeps seeking payment to read an article. No login button,0
After update : Error logging in. Error sign-up.,0
Doesn't let me sign in into an account keep saying link expired even that I just received it.,0
It's a paid service so many apps for open source with this content.article also not in brief,0
Medium has gone downhill very fast. The quality of stories seems to get worse by the day. I highly suggest paying for a better news source or sticking to niche blogs.,0
"Not gonna lie, this app sucks. The UX is just not intuitive at all. I can't see other people's comments, what's the use of the app? I'll go back to reading it on mobile.",0
"To read even some basic articles , it's asking for payment.. very bad",0
"Give me more free content, with or without ads I don't care.",0
"Website lies. Downloaded app to leave commentnon article. There os no option to do so, regardless of what your own pop ups say. Not to mention the reason i wantes to comment was because the article was so clearly biased and paid for it actually WAS funny. Yall get paid to write, yet have the balls to demand a monthly fee? For what? To use MY phone internet? HA! Trash ass clickbait.",0
Why so much paid promotion. Leave something free!,0
I cannot read a single article free... You need to be free some article for free user...,0
Any news try to open asking for subscribe .,0
"Can't you people find revenue sources other than making every stuff under mandatory subscription. I was about to leave quora and start using medium instead, but, first experience from you made it nearly impossible.",0
"It contains some good technical articles (computer science, math, etc), but the recommender system is designed such that it pushes some garbage (political/social garbage you see everywhere) into your feed, even if you constantly tell it you do not want to read that. Seems that the whole purpose of that recommender is to popularize ideological trash, instead of giving you the articles you care about. Canceled subscription as I do not sponsor garbage articles.",0
I am a first time user of the above said app and my first time seems to be like last as this app is not evn letting me to sign in.It sends a mail to verify my mail and i swear i click on the verification thing seconds later and viola! the app says this its verification link expired or timed out!! i dont know what kind of a verification process is that.,0
"Everyday I get push notifications recommending me articles. Everyday I click on this notification. And everyday, I'm disappointed by the inability to read the article because it's a members only article. Almost every single article recommended to me is members only. I get that you want to push your membership and make money for your business. But I simply can't afford it currently and it's a waste of time to even look at recommended articles because they're almost never free.",0
"BS, says install to comment. No comments can be added. Dont bother. The stories are from unintelligable writers who have a silly personal view.",0
"It is acceptable to limit amount of articles that subscription free users can read monthly, though it made the app and web site completely unusable. In fact this app takes 1.5G of a disk space on my phone. Assuming it caches everything even if users cannot fully use it, what for you need all this caches data?",0
"The app is almost unusable if you dont pay for a membership. For example, of the first 50 articles shown in my feed, only 7 were not member exclusive. It is incredibly frustrating to have the vast majority of the articles shown essentially only being ads to buy a membership.",0
It's just too expensive. I would happily pay per article but paying every month and hoping I find something worth reading? Especially when I can't even browse the choices properly unless I pay? Just not worth it.,0
"This is blog hell. I decided to join Medium after reading Tomas Pueyo's excellent series on the coronavirus. Another writer, Umair Haque, also wrote knowledgeably about it, although his writing was like a series of Instagram posts without pictures. Drew Magary is a writer I enjoy. I assumed I was paying a yearly fee so Medium could hire top shelf talent. I should have done my research. This is just a platform for bloggers, with all the worst stereotypes. ""Here's 2,000 words about something I just learned about!"" Some articles are nothing but reformatted Wikipedia pages. The quality of the writing is generally appalling. Don't waste your money.",0
"Totally biased liberal b.s. like most of their kind. No different. All the same narratives and agendas you'd expect from the lamestream media are pushed. The only difference is they have no accountably so they're more extreme, absurd and nonsensical than usual.. great if you like living in a bubble and want to stay that way. A complete waste of time for literally anyone outside of that 😂... Easy come, easy go...",0
Paywalls everywhere. Uninstalling.,0
"Extremely user unfriendly. In fact, most user unfriendly of all blogging sites. I would rather use a free, ad filled blogging domain than something like this. Formatting your articles will never be enough until you play by a whole constitution of rules.",0
"hi guys i cannot login with Facebook - shows error that app. is in development mode. i cannot login with Google. so basically i cannot use this app at all. sirry guys, but it's one star. once it's fixed, I'm happy to change the rating. thanks rado",0
Without any doubt it's a great platform of such a wonderful articles .But when you read alots of article in the beginning then most of articles were free at that time . But after using it more then a month it's become hard to find any free articles which suck,0
Comment section not visible.,0
"Besides the fact that the app's topics and ""personalized feed"" system are very faulty (bordering on useless), I'd also rather view ads than only have 3 articles to read per month. Not really worth the free download.",0
Forces app installation instead of allowing users to view via a web browser.,0
Unable to sign in by email,0
"i expect it to be user friendly and free of cost. when browser reading can be availed free of cost, why put such restrictions on app medium. highly disappointed in terms of trust and user friendliness",0
"says we cannot log you in, no matter whatever I do. Tried signing up with google, facebook, email. Nothing works",0
I like reading on medium a lot but I can't seem to make a payment. I have tried almost every account but it rejects everything. You need to fix this issue asap,0
The app is good but if i want to read the full article i have to pay the subscription but if the app will have an option like watch an ad to read an article then that would be great.,0
Blackmailing into paying for common readable stuff,0
"You have to pay for everything. The app is unsable without payment, I dont even know if I like it because I have to pay to discover it.",0
Dark mode makes article title at topic pages / home pages disappear. Can Medium fix this? I don't want to have my eyes fried when I read late at night :),0
Starts asking for $5 a month after reading a couple of articles.,0
Unable to login to the app. Everytime it says link expired even after clicking within seconds of receiving the mail.,0
I am unable to upload images. The screen is not fit to width. Testing must be done.,0
Sign-in with Google is not working in the app & in web i'm using same credentials & its working fine. please resolve the issue.,0
Consistently poor quality articles (Rob walker was just the most recent in a long line),0
"Medium's curating is non customizable (the top stories they push) and is designed to provide you a coherent but questionable narrative lacking any nuance whatsoever. Instead of medium, this app acts as a publisher and a very dangerous one at that.",0
Search feature in this app doesn't work,0
How can my draft stories are error and couldn't be loaded?? I just write so many words and now it is gone,0
"0 stars. Terrible articles. Not worth anyone's time unless you are actively trying to dumb yourself down. Unfounded claims, nonsensical ""humor"", baiting and bashing.... It's just no good.",0
Guys you need to sort your stuff in the facebook developer platform your facebook app isnt approved. And facebook users cant login. I will change my rating once youve solved the issue.,0
"For a non-mainstream news/ entertainment source, Medium purports to be different and viewing life from an independent perspective. However, most of your authors are nothing but MSM hacks waiting for their break. Those who leave their politics out of their blogs can be extremely entertaining. Ah, what a shame. And to think ""you could have been a contender""!",0
Cheap site for chep and hatefull articles. Never use this app. App with very less feature to write articles. Use different site or blog instead of this cheap Medium. Medium guys focus your site/app and t&c. BLOCK your account w/o any prior notice. You done nothing any wrong still dont know what they thinking.,0
"Not a good idea to install app, I can use my browser, don't see any benefits using the app",0
Cannot sign in with facebook though it shows facebook sign in option. It shows that the app is development mode and to sign in with facebook I needed to be a tester.,0
"I did have a year subscription, and it certainly wasn't worth renewing.",0
Great app indeed but you can read only few articles free which sucks 😑,0
The new version crashes when scrolling on some stories. Can we download the previous version anywhere?,0
Not sure where things went wrong but this app is now spreading misinformation from sensational to misleading headlines.,0
Subscribe only news. Better options exist. Nothing special here.,0
The restriction on number of articles is ridiculous. Perhaps creators need to able to choose if their articles should be behind a pay wall and you share the revenue with them.,0
Only two stories each month else you have to get membership which is not worth it at all.,0
I really hate this app... Everything here is paid....Everytime...they just ask for a membership...I really hate this !,0
Medium pushes too many US social politics articles (to daily story section) without me showing interest. Which isn't relevant for foreigners.,0
The app does not respond when I try to upload photos within the blog,0
It doesn't let you read any article unless you buy the premium version.,0
This kind of apps mostly available Free of cost but subscription required making this app worse. I don't like,0
Not have many purchase options . So annoying,0
Not free just for reading,0
Want only free content,0
can't log in. can't create an account. can't use.,0
Poor quality content for the asking price. Shame!,0
"Read one article, scrolled down a short list, then told my preview was over. 60.00 a year for an app I have no way of placing value on. I have no idea if the content is worth it. Will be deleting.",0
Just not good enough to get 5 stars,0
"Once you agreed to receive emails, only then and after then are you presented with 15 day trial offer. Then at that point you're unable to unsubscribe from the emails being thrown at you. Only option is to Mark as spam. They will continue to come to your Spam box forever and ever.",0
A best app gone paid that too so high good to uninstall it,0
The amount of free content available to you is ridicoulous. So greedy.,0
It should be free to use,0
Why on earth would this app be 1GB? Is it downloading all the saved articles??,0
Unreliable narrators. Terrible.,0
This app would be great but what makes this app a unusefull thing is there premium pack. You guys who have purchased the premium pack didnt even bother to google it if you would then you wont pay a single penny any more. App is too good to scroll and get articles if its free and had very little ad (no ads currently)to get over there expense and earn marginal profit instead charging us. Hope you guys wont spend money,0
Not like subscription cost its event more than Netflix or amazon prime,0
They want a monthly subscription now? Awww heck no! Fail! Free forum. Bye,0
"I am a paid member on medium. This app won't update my stories, comments, highlights, followers.. nothing. I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it again. It updated the content, but again wouldn't update anything new happening on my profile. Its awful. This needs to be fixed. I didnt have any trouble on iPhone. This app has not been updated since September 2019. You guys need to do a lot of work. Please!",0
"No more helpful app, even on opening a single article, they ask to upgrade. I have opened medium for 1st time this month, and it says, I need to upgrade as I have already read a lot this month. Kind of irritating.",0
I cannot login with email.,0
"Absolutely hate that I had no choice but to get this app just to reply to an article. It was an important correction, but I actually don't want a thousand apps on my phone, one for every website I visit. Surfing the web without apps wasn't broken. If your site doesn't fully function with ease without an app, I'll stop going entirely.",0
Why make it free when you will ask for money after 2 articles? Very bad,0
It will be the best app (I used it on my pc on web) but the worst thing is that you can not read anything without subscription after some time.,0
I m unable to write a story properly after putting images... I can't continue writing... So I hv to wrote first and then put images... It's exhausting... I just can't insert images in between texts... Very disappointed.,0
"Medium used to be free, and that's good for content by unknown authors and people writing about things they really aren't qualified to have a meaningful opinion about. But, now, Medium charges for this (mostly) trash.",0
"Edit: no reply, no respect for users = no subscription. Once the ""audio player"" opens up, how to close it (not minimize but close)? How to dismiss the green dot on the notification bell (which remains even after reading the notifications)? How to get a list of Editor Picks in the app, similarly to the website? Have you noticed how bad the search function is in the app and how the results are often irrelevant and all mixed up? How to sort the search results? Thank you",0
There is no earning platform for Pakistan. Please add a payment method for Pakistan too,0
"too much left wing garbage on it. even if i filter it out, in not going to pay and help support left wing garbage",0
Earlier it was such a great app now its all been downhill since.,0
"I read design articles from this site from time to time, so I decided to get the app. Deleted it after the onboarding process & looking thru just the front page of articles. This app is nothing but a stream of negativity - absolutely toxic. ""8 reasons why your relationship is actually really bad for you!"" """"The thing productive people do that you don't, stupid!"" ""Society is crumbling and here are the signs!"" No one needs this in their life.",0
"It's Pocket. Although unlike Pocket, it's completely useless without a paid subscription. Uninstalled after I finished my THREE free articles for the month in less than 15 minutes. Absurd.",0
"I keep downloading the app but every time I try creating an account it tells me something has gone wrong. This happens no matter what app I use to sign in. Please help, this app seems really great and I'd love to use it",0
There is so less of free articles and i cant afford the app anyway.,0
App is well but the search bar is not working.....So please fix this issue..........I am facing this from...Past few days if yiu will solve it then it will okk otherwise i'll uninstall it...,0
"Medium restricted my account for absolutely no reason, I didn't do anything wrong yet they felt the unnecessary need to restrict my account. I wouldn't trust this app or use it. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND.",0
The payment that comes with writing isn't even available in my country,0
"Love the desktop publishing features, but giving only one star since I cannot continue editing a 137 min read (!) I began a few years back. I certainly do not want to start writing all that from the beginning once again.",0
It's beautiful It helps me to improve my reading and writing abilities 😙,0
"Please remove your paid membership update. I hate this app a lot due to this humiliating thing. You can add ads, we don't have any issue with ads but knowledge is everyone's right and you can't just steal it like that from anyone accessing it. Period.",0
"Rubbish bin full of commercialized media waste. Was looking for the tech / software behemoth it used to be,but found a compendium of useless global media settings with totally unrelated nonsense and rubbish",0
I used to use medium daily for 4 years but now the free version is very limited. I uninstalled it,0
"I have really mixed feelings about medium. I really love the design, the idea and the execution. but after using this application for a while, a paywall will appear. You won't be able to read anything, of course notifications about new posts will still come. I really would wish that it would be possible to f.e. watch a video ad a day to read than having to subscribe. It's just not possible to fit that many monthly subscriptions.",0
"very low quality articles, even if there are good articles, its very difficult to find them, most articles suggested by medium are mostly less than average ones",0
The book i wanted to read was redirected to this app and when i installed the book was not available... really its not good to increase the subscribers unnecessarily... simply time waste...,0
"DON'T update! There is no ""bug fixes or other improvements"" They will monetize on you right now! I was using this app for a year and I loved it. It provided a platform for writers to be heard and at the same time for masses to read a good contents. After update it will cost you $5 a month for reading.. so much for educating masses.. otherwise you will be only able to read a heading, couple of paragraphs and then you will be naged for subscribing.. To Medium CEOs; you get what you deserve..",0
I was looking forward to exploring this app before committing to use it as either a contributor or a subscriber. But after reading a handful of articles the app became almost unusable without a subscription...,0
"There's a bug in the search menu. I can't type anything, the keyboard won't show",0
"I've put up with the bugs, especially around ""open in app"", for long but it keeps getting worse. Now I'm stuck in a loop of constant flashing as Chrome is trying to open the app and the app is redirecting back to Chrome. Not the first time this is happening that required an app update. What's the point of my premium subscription if I can't read anything on medium?",0
Very cleverly placed subliminaling messaging articles especially on the current Black lives matter movement. This required a response especially the article on Black people being racist. Its funny not only is this completely untrue (the origins of the word aswell as its systematic use)it is also being punted as passive aggressive response. Its classic misdirection from a source that has shown no solidarity with current affairs.,0
Seems like a nice app but garbage contents. Didn't spend a lot of time on it but the articles recommended gave very bad impression.,0
"The app allows readers a few free articles per month, but it this feature is horribly dysfunctional because I haven't been able to read one article for the last few months. It's much easier to use Chrome browser since no articles cost to read. Also, the recommendation function is out of hand and you aren't able to always come across genres you're interested in, but more so based on what you've read.",0
"App is OK, Medium does not edit biased writers.",0
"Whenever I open a Medium article on Chrome browser in my phone, it tries to open the same article in the app installed. This is ok as long as it opens the article in the app, and stays there. Instead it loops back to Chrome browser, and tries to open the same article in a new tab. And the process repeats. Have tried to reinstall the app and Chrome. Love the design, but have to uninstall the app until this bug is fixed. Disappointed to see such crappy app after being a paid member.",0
Don't bother if you're not planning on purchasing their subscription. Complete waste if time,0
"Lame! Tried to sign up with Gmail address. When I click on ""create account"" in the email it sent all I get is a blank page. This sign up thing is so stupid. Plenty of other news apps out there that don't require an account and actually work like they are supposed to. Medium had its chance. Don't waste your time. Uninstalled and moving on.",0
"Annoying push messages, with days in a row the same and the same over and over again.",0
New update is freezing new app and auto shutdown application. Still it restarting the app. It took more than 30 times restarts to read a single article. Can't you fix it. Still investing my time to read. I updated app from playstore about 50 times. What the hell you updated just now. Last updated in play store is 26 September. Do you call it as just now?,0
"Upon discovering this app, I was elated because of the idea of seeing new articles that are tailored to my viewing experience. The first two articles that have been recommended to me were an enjoyable read, not to mention they were also very useful for me. But as I scroll to view the next recommended article I see a pay wall. Rather limiting as a viewer. I feel betrayed. How can you advertise a product where you claim that it's not a place to sell words but further to further the conversation?",0
"I made a in-app purchase from your app by clicking 'upgrade' button, payment went through Google Play and amount of 3250 INR (dollar 50) got deducted from my account.  But it didn't reflect in my Google Play subscription. Also I received a error after payment on app something like ' Your card doesn't support automatic transaction'. Please investigate what is the issue here as I am unable to access the full contents of the app.",0
Good idea but the free articles are so limited in number that it does not make sense to maintain the app on my device. Uninstalled .,0
"Used to love this app, and service, until the paywall was introduced. I get notifications of articles to read... Paywall. I open the app and click on recommended articles... Paywall. I just don't see the point. Free to read articles feel non-existent so might as well just charge a subscription for the whole shebang and be done with it.",0
"Pushing premium like crazy and any article that is not technical in nature is an opinion piece. At the end of too many articles I find myself thinking what new information did I learn from this? Some person either loved something or they hated something, great..",0
"Downloaded the app to make it easier to start writing articles. The writing experience is awful compared to desktop, but, not as bad as non existent writing on mobile through a web browser! Try copying and pasting, hahaha, you lose all formatting, you can only c&p a paragraph at a time. Doesn't support writing code snippets using the back tick `. Just awful.",0
"For an app based on an up and coming blog site, it is odd you can not publish your own articles from the app. So you would need to use the website to upload your own stories so why not just read it there. Honestly save your time, save your money (it charges you after the first month), and dig into more traditional outlets if all you want to do is read not write.",0
"It indeed has some nice readings, and a very wide range of it. But its considered marked as free when it isnt... They only let you read around 3 articles, after that you have to pay. That is not ""in app purchase"" and instead of grabbing my attention and wanting to buy and read more, I actually feel betrayed and will uninstall it. A solution could be marking this correctly on the playstore, or strenghen your free offer to like 5 articles per day, something like that.",0
"What a joke! 2 ""free"" articles then they want a $5/mo. subscription to keep reading. While I might be willing to sign up, 2 articles (the ones I read, based on their recommendations, were generic paid advertising-type) doesn't provide enough information to make that commitment. Ideally they would have, at a minimum, a trial period with full access to make an informed decision. Lacking that, my decision was ""Uninstall.""",0
"The ""30 day free unlimited reading"" lasts one day. Then you can only view the first couple sentences before it locks and says you need to pay for a membership to keep reading. My daily email says I've 27 days left of unlimited, but I can't read more than the first sentence of any of the linked articles in that same email. Not worth $50 a year / $5/month, since the free trial isn't even free.",0
"For every one article I find that's halfway worthwhile, I have to slog through about a hundred mind-numbing ""OMFG TOP 5 X THINGS THAT WILL TOTALLY Y"" trash posts. And to read more than a couple articles a month, we're expected to buy a subscription (i.e. pay good money for clickbait trash with a bit of quality mixed in if you're willing to hunt for it). Hard pass, guys.",0
The fact that the home suggestions is 5/6 premium content is frustrating to me. It has turned me off from opening the app at all because it wastes my time by suggesting articles that I can't even read. If it was maybe half I would be more ok with the suggestions but otherwise makes me less likely to want to subscribe when it feels as if I don't get a choice in the matter.,0
"Please fix the UI. Swiping the cards left and right feels sluggish and unresponsive. I've been chatting with support for months, devs promised it will be fixed, but it still hasn't been prioritized. I refuse to pay for the service until this is fixed. I don't want such a poor experience to be part of a daily reading routine.",0
"It was working. I liked it. Until it stopped working. Now it enters an infinite loop that flashes black and white screens on my mobile. Sadly, I paid a subscription for that and now is completely useless. Response: no it isn't fixed. It still doesn't login via email. Further you hidden the email-based login. Apparently, this is done on purpose to lead login via google, etc, that allows you to extract personal info. I dont want to give you that info. Stop blocking me via ""bugs"".",0
This is a useless application. There's only one place you can go to read stories and they're all recommended. Before it was similar to the web version. The feed doesnt even load 75% of the time so I only ever see 1 story and since thats the only place to go the whole app is useless. And refreshing does nothing basically. Please save yourself the pain and just use the web version.,0
"While the content is great, if you plan to read most on your phone as I do, don't bother with either the app or subscribing. Tons of bugs, from listing only ""editor picks"" stories, stories from just one source, or sometimes only stories already months old and even over a year old with a few recent ones sprinkled in the middle to limiting the number of stories as you scroll down the home screen (you end up getting the loading icon and nothing ever loads, even if you restart the app). Need refund!",0
"All but unusable. The app chokes on handling external links which means I can't tap an article in my feed and read it in the app. Instead I have to note the title, open the app myself, and search for the article. That's assuming you can log into the app on the first place. Since logins are passwordless, you enter your email address and then receive a special link to authenticate. Unfortunately, since the app usually fails to handle external links, your login attempts will usually fail too.",0
Pretty much no control over your feed. No way to mute topics. No feed only for people who you follow. They feed you with what they want and it's mostly stuff I'm not interested in at all.,0
bookmark + archive + delete from reading list is not working properly. I am tired of seeing the articles that i removed from my reading list. Bookmark + archive + delete experience is terrible. You should redesign this part of the app. You better put this feature on swiping the cards on the reading list and a different approach on the article detail.,0
"In the days where everything you stream has a fee, I really thought that I wouldn't have to pay to read through subjective stories on a stylized and structured ap. The same or at least similar content is available online but here wrapped up in a neat little ap that you just tap on $5 a month or $50 for a year... People just really love to spend money on feeling included these days.... But I guess thats still cheaper than womens weekly.",0
"The app itself worked fine, no crashes and good design. HOWEVER The recommended articles were shallow, bleak and boring. Regardless of clicking the 'show me less' it still recommended terrible articles mostly written by dull bloggers. I stopped my payed subscription but now I've decided to just delete the app. Would also like to stop receiving e-mails. Very disappointed.",0
"""Free month"" disappointment: it only allows one ""free"" story read and then prompts an upgrade to view further content. That is not a ""free month"" nor can one ascertain whether or not to purchase membership. Btw the story I read was an old news, from 2012. I could easily find the same story/content for free via any search engine. *shrugs*",0
"Unable to use the app, because I can't login, email login keeps saying the link has expired, even though I use the link almost instantly... definitely uninstalling",0
"I have been trying to buy the one month premium membership for a very long time. But none of the modes of payment work. It says unavailable for this purchase. For every mode- debit card, UPI, PayPal, Netbanking, etc. I thought it was a bug and updated the app but it made no difference. It's really disappointing when I have to do my research work using this platform but I can't view more than a few and I can't also purchase the membership, so it's a dead end for me. Please fix it soon.",0
"The app crashes more often than I would want, doesn't allow me to highlight and too intrusive when I try to read in browser (since it doesn't allow me to highlight in the app). But the most annoying thing with this app is the log in. Somehow they're sure it's a good idea to not allow users to log in with login and pass. You must get email link or sign in via social media. Disaster.",0
Hi i am a premium subscriber of the app from two years nw. I would really like to hv a better bookmarking system (with tags etc) within Medium to classify the archived & bookmarked articles so that i can read them at a later date. Please take this matter with priority. Right nw it's very difficult to handle bookmarked articles. (Update) There is no update that will address this issue so far. I don't think its hard for your team to give its users a better bookmarking experience. It's necessary.,0
"I didn't read a single article. Just installed the app. Few days later I wanted to read... and couldn't. At the beginning of the first article I started there's a note that I need to upgrade... to pay. LOL. Thank you, but NO thank you. This app is waste of space and bandwidth I used to download it. UNINSTALL",0
Pay for reading articles. Very strange.,0
"Remove that 'open in app' banner on every page for Christ sake. I need to close it on EVERY page and it always come back. It's so annoying! I'm just fine with the website. Don't you think that if I close the banner 30 times in a row, I'll still may install the app next time you will show that banner?",0
"After reading an article on Medium, it implied I could/should read the responses using the Medium app. I installed it and found it is next to useless. I'd read responses for a bit, then it would say I needed to read them in the app WHICH IS WHERE I ALREADY WAS. It was like going around in a circle. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work so it's now uninstalled.",0
"One star to get your attention. Mostly I use app to appreciate how beautiful my/other blogs are. There is a bug which needs to be fixed asap When i am using embeddings in my post, for eg, jupyter notebook through gist link, within app i cannot scroll down the notebook and it remain fixed at one postion. If I am reading blog in a browser tho, it works fine. So may be ur app team have a priority issue to fix. Thanks",0
"Endless daily messages about articles, even though you can only read a couple of articles before becoming a member. Message is:- here's an amazing article to read but you can't read it unless you pay because you've reached your mknthly limit (3 free articles is it?). Maybe a reminder once a week but daily .... !!! Made me so sick I deleted the app. Like pushing chocolate in your face everyday (!!!!) then withdrawing it and demanding money first. After two weeks, stop emailing/messaging PLEASE!!",0
"After last update the app is freezing for 10 seconds every couple of clicks or during scrolling through the story. This makes the app pretty much unusable. Too bad guys, but I will have to switch to web for the time being. The general idea behind new bookmarks management is great but the implemention is very poor. Archived or removed bookmarks can appear in the app next day. PS. Stop doing stuff on the main thread guys...",0
"What a sucking app, i downloaded to read some useful content and when i click to read , you start begging for subscription...purely money minded app. No value for readers, what they want is money, they will not allow you to read any content without subscription.",0
"Terrible app. Would suggest using Chrome instead to view Medium articles. First things first, app seems to be very RAM hungry so it gets killed off repeatedly. When reaccessing the app after it has been killed, clicking the app VS accessing from runnning apps would bring user to different screen. WHY?! Most importantly, no read history whatsoever, couple with app getting killed repeatedly means losing read history ALL. THE. TIME. Terrible app. Chrome just does everything better+read history",0
"Do not like that the app has no concept of previous reading history. So, if you have it open then click on a notification, it opens new article and you have no idea what you were reading before it opened link. I am removing the app because then it will show medium articles in Chrome and I will have my history of what I read.",0
"Used to be fantastic, now the cost of the subscription is a significant barrier between me and Medium. It used to be a great place to read well-thought-out stories, documents, lessons etc. but unfortunately I'm not willing to pay a significant monthly/annual fee for the privilege. I understand that they need to monetise, but I think they've got the business model all wrong.",0
"Horrible experience. I tried to upgrade my account in-app becaise I valued the content and want to support authors. The payment attempt for an annual plan failed repeatedly, with a payment failed error. Then the same error occurred on my attempt to purchase a monthly subscription. My account still shows as free, and I'm out of articles. I thought, no harm... But now I see multiple transactions on my credit card totalling hundreds. What a headache.",0
Loved medium until the new billing system came where you need to have a paying account to access a lot of content . I get it that they are a business and they have to earn somehow but can't it be with ads or something equal where you don't have to put your credit. Doesn't it conflicts the whole idea of sharing knowledge medium so proudly promotes. Bottom line you i quit medium and started consuming knowledge and learning elsewhere. Knowledge and sharing knowledge shall always be free!,0
"Got this to read about technology, mostly annoyed by the paywall. What I really don't like is after a few weeks having it installed I receive notifications every day for articles about sex and relationships despite me never having read 1 article on this topic. I've read dozens about programming and data science, but I don't get any suggested articles about those topics, just sex and relationships. Uninstalled for that reason.",0
"I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to exploring Medium, but nothing will load. It's not my wifi connection. I can stream just fine. Everything else on my phone works. I'll try the app again in a few weeks. I hope it's just a bad update. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7",0
"All the premium posts pollute this app. As, all those who do not want to buy the premium app. Are just sitting slugs. This is the reason all I like is nothing but only premium post. I hate this app. I haven't even read a single post in it.",0
"This is a terrible app. There is no clear cut ways in which you can feature images to your post. Writing on it is quite painful too. The autosave is good, but it has probably just 10 percent of the features of using it on a computer. The hyperlinks feature also does not work properly. Why release a half-baked product?",0
"App is broken. Whenever I try to open a medium link from Google news in the app, the screen starts flickering wildly and I lose all control of my phone. This bug has been around for a little while now, I just hope that it gets fixed soon, because I want to read the articles.",0
"1. Getting ""Error in downloading a draft story"" i recieved a msg saying story is being edited somewhere else which i was'nt !! After that i recieved this error. 2. The text keyboard goes away while editing story . Everytime , i have to go back and come back to draft and rewrite/start typing ... 3. Their is no support for handling these type of errors ... Which is the worst ...",0
So far useless. Says no connection and won't display any stories. I have restarted phone since installing and no change. I am able to do the rest of my surfing and am receiving notifications. This is the only app that seems to be having problems.,0
"The application itself is beautiful, but it shows a few problems with Medium that cripple the app experience and ruin the app for me. The app recommendations are spam for paywalled articles that are only available in the app if I pay for a membership. Not only that, but these are articles that are free to read in the browser if I don't sign in. The app also strips ""friend sharing"" links so articles by my friends that would bypass the paywall can't be read in the app. I've uninstalled it.",0
"App only lets you have a few free views before it prompts payment. Too bad i literally only read 1 article and then spent 5 minutes trying to figure out the following: A. How to make a comment B. why was my feed only one type of article subject C. How do you get to categories? Guess what? I never figured out b and c, and i read what to do to make comments but couldn't test it due to the paywall. This was a pretty crappy experience. Wth would I pay for that?",0
Medium definitely has good content. But the mobile app is junk. Frequently require to clear cache to see latest content. If you tap on a new post notification it will take you to the Medium home page. The web app has the most screwed algorithm for search optimization. You can be pretty sure that the safest place to keep your journals safe on the Internet is Medium. Nobody will find it ever!,0
"Medium is the Quora of unasked questions: ""experts"" that write on topics, generally with more care and more thesaurus, but discussion's on a piece appear maybe ~1/10 (""authors"" unwilling to open their work to scrutiny). The app is virtually locked until you pay for a ""Membership Fee,"" that is dispersed to writers based on the number of claps they get. So you have to pay...to earn, which makes sense..(?) Overall, I've checked out Medium off & on for a year or two--Ive yet to be compelled to pay.",0
"The app only recommends premium articles, totally kills the experience of how it was before. Is like pushing extremely for you to pay the premium membership. I just wanted to read the authors that I like and they're not premium but is impossible to have it on my home screen. Deleting this cr*p",0
Not worth the money. The article seems to be not the most recent one but randomly generated around the past time. I really like the UI but that alone cant justify the fact that the basic article needs to be paid. About 40 dollar per year for lame article that is not always based on fact but just merely an opinion. And you can always read ANY article for free but from the website by right clicking the article and open in incognito mode. You will be reading for free without any page block. (0o0),0
"Pushes notifications to tell you about articles and then doesn't let you read them because you hit some nebulous limit for the month. I can understand having a limit on free articles per month and I can understand using notifications to present potentially interesting articles, but you can't have the notifications and the limit and not have the former account for the later. Also, it's painful to find and navigate the comments.",0
"Great content Edit: Opening external links has been fixed, thank you Medium! Developers, please implement something similar to Kindle's ""whisper sync"", that would be amazing! Edit2: opening external links through the Google app on Android does not work. I see the medium app loading screen and then it prompts me to select a web browser to open the link. Once fixed I will change my review back to 5 stars.",0
"I was one of Medium biggest fans since its 1st days out there. However recently i cannot read even one article due to this stupid #You reached your free preview limit for this month"" message which appears constantly even in the 1st seconds of the 1st hour of the 1st day of the month!!! I will not upgrade my account to premium because i don't have the money for it. If you want to be this way then suit yourselves you just lost one of your fans.",0
"Content behind paywall. Profiting from open source, public knowledge and third party authors....",0
"It started out as a very good app to gain knowledge.. but after a while, medium started recommending only paid content. This app became totally useless. I understand that medium needs to promote its membership. But recommending all the paid contents is definitely not the way to do it..",0
"Just another app hiding behind a pay wall. Wants me to subscribe because I've been reading for a month when I just installed it yesterday, not sure how that works. Content is pretty bad to begin, so with why on Earth would I pay for it? There's so many better and free options out there. This is a joke and a scam.",0
"Pay-walled content, no thanks.",0
"With a paid active subscription, I was constantly refused access to content I was interested in and so it was a complete waste of my time and money especially since I canceled today with eight months remaining on my subscription. No refund offered. Don't ever nag a subscriber to subscribe as you just lost one! I feel that the cost of my subscription was stolen!",0
just a ploy to get subscriptions.,0
"Wow, I turn on the app to read something and it says ""youve used all your monthly reading."" Lol. I havent turned on this app for months. How the hell did I use up my month. Try to email them to let them know. Cant find the email anywhere. 1 star.",0
"Super annoyed that there is a paywall behind a monthly quota. Feels the same as big media to me, even though most of the (admittedly good, although generally pretty succinct) content seems to be crowdsourced. If people are giving them the content, then charging for it by policy seems like a violation to me. Tear down that wall",0
"Buggy, it keeps bringing you up to the top suddenly, hard to get to read the article in entirety, if you scroll down, then if you go slightly up again to review something, then continue down, all of a sudden, for no reason it brings you up to the top of the article. Waste of time, not worth it, fix it!",0
"Only giving it 1 star because 0 isn't an option. Why an article based app is paid is beyond me. There are millions of ways to say why this is a bad idea, number 1 being: Why would I pay for something readily available elsewhere for free? Really? How devoid of market logistics and illiterate regarding audience relations are you? Pathetic. This app should be free, and for good reason.",0
"Centered on the US. As in I wasnt able to set even a region or the country that I want news from, so I uninstalled it as soon as I had set it up. Otherwise seems like it might be cool, I just have no frame of reference nor do I WANT to have more of a frame of reference than I have for the US and news from there.",0
"As a reader: 3 free articles per month without a subscription? Lmao this isn't the NYT. Garbage service anyways with all the email spam, notification spam, and subscription requirements.",0
"I can't understand why I'm not able to read a complete article which says something like ""20 things you should know "" . I open it there's no content but other headings . What's wrong?",0
"UPDATE I would give this a zero stars if i could. Now they are forcing people to sign up to read. Updating my Google preference to never see another medium article again. I don't understand why this app gets such a high score. It's shewing up my battery while I'm not even using it, even after I blocked the annoying media controls it throws in the notification area",0
"My Google Play payment has never registered on my Medium account, even after resetting the account as instructed by Medium support. Apparently there is no administrative framework on the Medium side to fix this. Makes me distrust the site altogether. Letting my membership lapse before they take more of my money. Disappointed.",0
"It's crazy how this app goes from critical bug to a critical bug. It's like they don't test it at all? My latest issue is that all medium links open the medium app which then immediately opens a browser to read the article. Why would you ever forward to browser from the app? And now the web page even doesn't show the ""open in app""button anymore.",0
i give one star bcz there is no option regarding 0 star it the worst app i have ever seen. problem i faced 1. it is very heavy app it is not functioning properly 2. i uploaded my dp on it. it show always loading loading after some time it said please try after some time.... after some time i try to upload it shows again and again same message suggestion your computer version website is okk work on your app. reduce the size of app,0
"This app is listed as a top grossing app, but only because they offer you a free subscription then steal 49.95 from your Google pay. There is no way to contact them to contest the chages and will not issue a refund. A real honest business would issue a refund upon request when no services were rendered. They care only about thier pockets not thier members.",0
"App does not sort as per your recommendation. You have to select the topic you are interested in, but I rarely saw any article related to the topic I selected.",0
"I was really excited by the idea of Medium as a platform, but after using it I am very disappointed. Edits don't propagate to mobile apps, eiting is clumsy at best and the paid tier wall is not what I was expecting from the initial promise.",0
"How can reading articles on Medium be more expensive than streaming music on deezer? The app does not do a good job in clearly showing me which are free articles and which are not so I end up clicking and reading heading and doing the same thing over and over. Can I choose to see only the free content? Because I have no plans of paying for 4 minute articles that read like Facebook posts, when music on deezer is still free. Like never ever!!!",0
"Used to love medium, but the price made it not worth it to keep a subscription, and the very low monthly free article cap (5?) is infuriating. I more often see the ""free articles exceeded"" message than actual content. Not worth the frustration.",0
Don't know someone hacked my phone with this app. As soon as I came from India they were waiting to connect with these kind of apps how to use my phone without installing any app anything! This is the key entire phone is connected to frd fed Samsung mobile till now,0
Awful. It does not allow reading without subscription awhile or use possible on its website,0
still cant sort the search result by date or anything! this is the most basic feature someone needs and its still not available!,0
"Content is great but the app has one bug on pixel2 that causes articles to autoscroll up away from where im reading around the 75% mark, requiring to scroll down and find the exact place where I was reading. It continues to happen, prevention me from finishing the articles, which is ultimately why I wrote this review.",0
"This app is the best example of ""How greed causes companies to falter"". I had downloaded this app upon coming across some wonderful articles in varied domains. All was going well when the app used to recommend articles to read that were actually accessible to the non-premium users. But now any and every 'recommended' read is a paid article. The first 10-15 or more articles on the home page are paid articles. You're just pushing people away if no decent unpaid articles are to be 'recommended'.",0
"One of the worst app that's out there, the design and Everything else is tbh fine? But they let you read like 5 articles a month which are FREELY available online and if you want to use it any further you're supposed to PAY to read news. I don't generally review applications, but I had to say this. Absolute waste of time and space.",0
"clicked on ONE link and decided to give the app a chance. Upon opening the app i was informed that this was my one and only article that i could read without paying. Sorry guys, have you heard of this internet thing?? PLENTY to read and majority of it is free. I'm sure its not all that hard to get the content fron your site for free as well, which is exactly what happens, one person with access to the site downloads the articles and redistributes your content without anyone's consent.",0
Medium Ultra review 2020 Quality of News: Decent News Rating: Somewhat Satisfied Uninstalled App: Yes Successful Reason: Tired of seeing you've reach the end of your free membership preview for this month. Will you recommend this to your friends: Maybe Additional comments: Provide additional value to your readers. Suggestions to improve: Include additional free features by engagement and include acceptable payments methods such as Bitcoin. Total Score: Rating 1,0
Ads+subscriptions? Bad business model! Content is meaningless instantiation of the same writing formulae.,0
"Forced app install is a dark pattern. Medium really lost it's way, sad and increasingly irrelevant.",0
"A rip-off. Medium used to be a great community. Now it shuts people out of the paywall. If Medium contained quality journalism (like the Guardian which I voluntarily pay a subscription for to support) I could understand the high cost. But the whole idea is supposed to be a blog platform where professionals, amateurs and enthusiasts can share ideas and content - how can Medium justify such a high cost to use their platform?",0
Can't even install it. Enter email address but when I click on the link in the email it's blocked by ms 365.,0
Most articles are pay to read. It's a decent app otherwise. Maybe I'll check this again in few years. Hopefully it will be friendlier for those who are intent on not paying just to read an article by some amateur bloggers.,0
"The app would be great except 95% of the articles are members only and there is no way to hide them, so you have to scroll forever and only see 3 or 4 articles. They should update this listing to say ""requires subscription""",0
I'm unable to log in... I tried many many times but i couldn't really disappointed,0
"Skip this app if you have Android. It doesn't have basic functionality that every other similar app has. For example, if you click on an article, you have to search for it again when the app opens. Dumb. Would not have purchased if I noticed this before.",0
The app is almost useless if you don't pay premium. I can barely read three articles before it locks me out. $50 a year is also an insane amount to pay just for reading blog posts and articles while you can read blog posts and articles for FREE on the internet.,0
I can't log in. I was so happy when i install it plz fix it.,0
"This app used to be great, you could access all articles from different authors but now every article requires a premium membership. They got greedy and have restricted their users from about 95% of the content. Disappointed.",0
"Sadly I can't say how good this app is, I followed all loading instructions and all it keeps doing is ""Buffering"" so that's why it gets one 🌟..... I'll keep trying but if it continues buffering and not load up I will have to ""DELETE"" this app 😔....... Decided I'm deleting it will Not loaden up and I really can't be bothered trying anymore... SORRY GUYS",0
useless app.The website is forcing users to open the blog in app and the app can't open it.,0
"Medium seemed good when I installed it, and it has an elegant interface. Yet, what the hell? 3 free stories? I assumed SOME stories are premium. But no, basically ALL are premium. 3 stories per month is such a ridiculous thing... Jeez.",0
I like the articles but what I don't like is that there is no option to select the whole text from the article so I can read it out loud on another application. that alone made me uninstall it. but if you like looking at your phone and read the articles. you may like it,0
This is aweful. Beyond words useless. I had been trying to choose a blogging platform and several reviews on seemed to say medium was what I needed. I tried several times to create a blog. That doesn't actually seem to be the focus here they just want to cram their content down your throat. I had to follow a link from a third party website to start a blog. You must upload a photo to continue but when I clicked I got an upload failed message. I HAD NOT selected a photo yet.,0
"My paid subscription never materialized and I was asked to pay again! Now this app has my payment info and I am unable to access anything. This is BS! Lots of luck trying to reach support through the ""chat"" or finding any other contact. I'm reporting this for fraud. If my financial account is touched in any way, I will see an attorney.",0
"The app would be great but why the hell isn't it showing the topics that I subscribed to?? I just get ""popular topic"" articles on my home page that I'm not interested in... Maybe you have to be a member?? Think about your strategy. If you had shown me my topics and gave me a free month instead of just 3 articles I probably would have stayed.",0
"I can't even read one story. I was interested by suggestion for my daily read. Unfortunately everytime I try to open an article it keep close automatically without further notifications. Please fix it, and I might change the review.",0
I'm angry that i can't prevent this medium app from being used to open all underscore all articles on medium which i open in my browser. That's completely unacceptable because I often want to use the ability of browsers to track multiple tabs of articles or search articles or share them in certain ways and I don't want to open them in medium. so I'm just uninstalling medium itself,0
Cannot edit . it shows medium stopped . cannot delete a post. cannot do most of the things. if we need to only use the computer version for important features why create an app that is almost not useful ? the previous update had good additions. Now we cannot even work properly.,0
"Once installed you can't read any paid articles from your browser. The app redirects any login to Medium from Chrome to the app, but without keeping the paid article that you are trying to read. So if you found an interesting member only articles on Chrome and want to login to read it, it will redirect to the Medium app front page but not the page you want ro read.",0
This app is useless without a paid membership. All the articles I get in my feed are premium articles. The app tells me this after I open them so I spend most of my time on the app opening articles and closing them because I don't have access to them!,0
"Despite telling medium my interests (which dont include politics), every. Single. Article. Was something about why I should feel bad for being a white person. It doesnt make for an enjoyable experience. Im not saying I disagree or agree with those articles, but I just didnt realize I was downloading ""white guilt trip"" the app.",0
Will not pay for articles when I can find for free. I would rather deal with ads. It was cool before I realized it was a pay for app. I may come back when the content fall more in the realm of a intellectual level. Basic artics with not real content doesn't fit my need of daily need.,0
"This app is persistently most horrible, the passages you highlight don't remain highlighted, the highlights and responses don't update in your profile, I've contacted support multiple times and they did absolutely nothing about it. The app crashes too.",0
Clicked on an article and changed my mind which one to read because there were 2 that interested me. Backed out of the first read I picked and then my daily read was over. Now I can't read either of them. This app can't even tell if you read an article and it only gives you 1 read a day. Uninstalling.,0
I'm surprised people like this app. All I want is a list of the articles from writers I follow on Medium. Instead when I open the app I'm confronted with an avalanche of divisive and not otherwise insightful work from authors I've never heard of. Is it too much to ask to see a feed of followed content?,0
I didn't read half an article! After less than 3 minutes of installing the app... and then surprised by: [You read a lot. You'v had all your free stories for non members for this month. Upgrade for unlimited access. Upgrade for 5$ I wrote this review and going to uninstall it.,0
"Just see this as a ""paid app"" because you really cant see anything",0
Every time I click a Medium link it gives me a push notification on other stuff I should read and stalls my reading of the original link for several seconds while opening it in the app. This is seriously annoying. I like the publication but I'll just read it in browser from now on.,0
Haven't been able to login since last update. Please help,0
enjoyed this app so far has a lot of great stories in this app great enjoyed it a lot while it lasted which i was i was not informed of till after words that i have to pay for it 😒 i would love to pay for the app but i have no money or anything else cause I am very poor cause of being on SSI and living in nursing home and just plain poor person but oh well,0
The algorithm eventually narrows your reading options down to the same topic. You can't reset your reading preferences to widen your interests. This app is for slowly training the algorithm to deliver the most effective click bait and trap you in a bubble.,0
"Unable to get logged in. Email which is being sent to my outlook account, clicking on same opening same login page despite selecting medium as app. For website also no creds are being provided. At my work I'm not supposed to open personal e-mail and thanks to your login system I'm unable open medium it just keep sending email to account which couldn't be opened from browser for some reason.",0
"No way to get support through the app, maybe someone will notice here? A few days ago some articles started entering an infinite loop of attempting to open with chrome then medium and back and forth.

Scrolling and suddenly an article that I have desire to read, counts as one of my free reads...urrrrrgh. Needs a popup. Additionally, if you do not have paid membership your articles never get curated. And the dynamics of the whole membership thing is a complete turn off...I could subcribe and not see a penny...at least so it appears to me.",0

"I have read a couple of articles on medium website, then it very annoyingly kept prompting me to download the app. ok so i gave in and just downloaded it. now every single story i click on i am asked to upgrade to read and pay for membership? ive read literslly two articles. very frustrating 👎",0
"It keeps saying something went wrong, try again later both when I try signing signing in and signing up for a new account.",0
"if you are planning on just doing the free account, dont bother. medium used to actually be useful, but no longer is due to the 3 free monthly 'premium' articles just disappearing despite not using the app for 2 months. a waste of soace on your phone.",0
The app had potential but the recommendations AI sucks now. It forces me to read the jargons from trending topics.,0
"It always delays too much for load any kind of article. I don't know how I can help, but it would be awesome if I get this working as it was previously when my Android wasn't at version 8. I'll update this review if it works properly asap.",0
"Buyer Beware! I regret paying for this app. First, know that anything that you highlight will be available for others to see. 2nd, know that any comment you post will not be unpostable...ever. Your posted stories will need a bizarre workaround to edit. 3rd, you will not get customer service. You will get an annoying chat that sends you nowhere. Developers never ask for your opinion or permission. Use the free version until they mature.",0
"All tho there is some nice content , it is eclypsed by the amount of unchecked or innacurate articles and tutorials . the fact that now is subscription base, makes it unusable. i guess i will just Tor in if someone recomends me to read something from them",0
I absolutely did not download this and I don't know why it's on my phone. I'm not technology ignorant like many who accidentally download something. I'm usually the one giving my elderly relatives the rundown on not clicking on things and trying to clean their phones out after they have so the fact is this is on my phone really irritates me,0
The app won't let you read any article. Always asking for free trial.,0
Goodbye Medium. You have too many articles behind a pay wall and you mostly recommend articles to me that are behind that wall. Medium has really gone down hill and doesn't seem to care about it's reader the same way it did. As a web developer I now prefer using dev.to for my technical articles. Goodbye Medium.,0
"I am a premium user and I cannot even save articles to read them offline (for example during flights), even though I have a good internet connection when I am trying to save them. Really disappointed with my purchase. Not recommended.",0
Everything doesnt have to be a subscription based service. I would be more than happy to pay $5 or $10 bucks for the app...but $5 a month for amateur articles is absurd. Guess I will move on to the next Google Reader replacement.,0
"Terrible! Dont download this app. One you download it all the content you were reading becomes stuck behind a pay wall!! Even content that's not coming from medium websites. Do yourself a favour, ignore this app go directly to the website and read all your content for free without being forced to pay for it!! Update: Looking at app reviews medium is only comnenting on good reviews! No one star reviews get comments.",0
"Got this app for articles related to work, and would be five stars if it stuck to that. Unfortunately, the app forces a constant barrage of social, political, and now sexuality articles. I only asked for a few work-related publications. No way for me to block the ""Sexology"" publication from my suggestions, for instance",0
Knowledge should be free. I don't understand why we have to pay. Do you pay they people who write the articles? If not then you should not be paid too. I know that you'll say that the platform has costs but please find other ways to pay these costs.,0
"Medium is great. Support and social? No one answers. What happened to me? Viewed 10 articles on a certain topic and the algorithm started only showing me content of that subject destroying my feed. I ask for a reset of my account or anything to tame the recommendations. No one answers, shows Medium does not care.",0
"Not able to sign in via the app. On selecting the option to sign in via email, it gives an option to enter the email id and asks to verify the sign in by clicking on the verification link in the email. But on doing so it opens the app but gives an error - could not login and asks to re-enter the email id.. and it repeats the loop 🤦🏻‍♂️",0
"A lot of unnecessarily biased and subjective writeups I have never asked for. Canceled trial and deleted account. Quora is way more about data, facts, opinions. Somehow this app doesn't work for me.",0
At the beginning I was very glad that had signed up for the mediumhowever I soon discovered that it was all about money as I began to read certain articles I found that I had to upgrade in order to complete my reading of these articlesI found it to be a disgrace that all they were after its money I think that if it's free it's free and that's the way it should be I understand that upgrading brings in new revenue however this is not explain that the beginning and I'm very disappointed and I am co,0
"Keeps automatically scrolling articles that contain embedded content, so frustrating. Also, horizontally navigating lists is a real chore, unless you swipe completely horizontally the view moves vertically instead. This app has always been buggy, is it even tested before release??",0
An app is supposed to bring additional functionality and make it easier to use compared to a Web Application. But this app is a pure downgrade because of the difficulty in trying to edit any posts/responses you make.,0
"The app is just terrible. No PWA. Does not work offline, even if I prefetch all images and external links of an article. Only installed it because of the annoying pop-ups on the medium site, but changed my mind after a 5 mins of use.",0
"Seems to get confused if have previously opened a link that needed ""open in browser"" and then thinks the current article is in a browser rather than the app eg. reading an article, click to add it to my reading list, and it responds by launching a pop-up inviting me to get the app.",0
The horizontal scroll is just unusable. You have to care so much not to move your fingers vertically so that it wouldnt scroll vertically! I waited so long for this to improve but nothing is done.,0
nonsense! not satisfied at all......thought a lot bout this app but of no use. simply asking for money at every stage.....first waste ur money on downloading it & then for upgrading it....just robbing the pockets of the public.,0
"Was in middle of publishing when the update came and ever since I can't publish anything or save. Seems like it isn't just me. Love Medium but won't give five stars until this is fixed, it's pissing me off.",0
"Once upon a time I gave this app 5 stars. I love reading stories and writing my own. It felt like a positive and creative community. Now, unless I pay for a membership, I can only read 3 stories a month. 3 stories written by users, not professional writers. Reddit is free and I can find the same quality stories there. Goodbye medium, you were once a great community. Now you're just another crappy app.",0
what the hell.... two stories in a month! why to download it ??? go to google and read unlimited.. developer please work on it otherwise its useless app and am keeping in mobile in hope for update in which we can read more stories without paying anything otherwise it has no use and will uninstall it !!!,0
"I tried opening a url from chrome, was redirected to the app where I must sign up to see the content.. Uninstalled and reopened the link with no problem. Ever heard about something called UX ?",0
All good until they wanted me to pay for subscription. This apps business' model is not a good idea. You should consider reinventing that part. With so many subscription services out already medium is definately one to be dismissed.,0
I really like this app but I cant subscribe. Appears to have tons of great articles to read. My password is correct. Keeps telling me my password is wrong.,0
"Echo chamber for liberal, socialist, communist and fascist views. Ironically given the socialist nature of almost all articles, everything is behind a pay wall. As far as the app goes, it's not bad, news reader like most others, nothing to recommend.",0
I used the app a lot on my previous phone but now I switched and cannot login with Google because there's something going on with sign in when there are multiple Google accounts. Please fix so I can give you an honest review!,0
"Uninstalling. App seemed great at first. Then discovered it cuts you off after so much reading and forces you to pay. No thanks. There are other apps I can use to read. I'll keep my money, thanks.",0
"Used to be OK, but they changed their business model to make virtually any piece a premium one. It's not longer an information sharing platform.",0
"Website has all the features, I could read/write do everything there but when I use there app, I've pay for reading a simple article! other companies give some extra benefits for using their apps, but they gave demerits... You guys could have gained revenue through Ads...",0
"This is a pretty great app, but it irks me to no end that the mechanism for saving articles is broken. The app consistently shows ""Saved (1)"" but no article displayed underneath.",0
"Almost 90% of the post in my feed are now premium articles that you have to pay for. That's so annoying, its not worth more all the hassle and scrolling to find a free post if you dont have the payed version.",0
Needing to upgrade to read more articles is a pain in the backside.,0
"There's now a limit of readings on the app. Just uninstalled it and got back to browser. If the browser starts doing that too, it's the time to search another platform...",0
"Not worth paying such an expensive membership. There out is full of newspapers, magazines, blogs and other media with 100% free content with the same or higher quality.",0
"Every time I click a link to an interesting article, this app opens and tells me I have to be a paid user to read it...that's pretty annoying especially since I can read it for free in a browser. Uninstalled.",0
Medium had some great technical and other articles but unfortunately it had a lot of naive moaners who just keep coming up in my daily feed. I do keep blocking these fools but more appear. When I can filter these out I will rate higher.,0
"Seems everything I want to read I get a short blurb and the rest is premium content. I can find plenty of content to read without it being organized in unreadable categories. Uninstalling, buh-bye... Worse, keeps sending emails even after you uninstall.",0
"The app seems to be a honey pot for forcing users into paying for the $50/year subscription. Before installing the app, I rarely saw any paywalls on medium. Now I see nothing but paywalls. Uninstalling.",0
"Since a while, I am not able to save the stories in the app. They do appear in the web tho. I tried to log out and then log in, but all my bookmarks disappeared (they are still on the web tho). What's the purpose of having this app? I don't know. If they fix it, I'll change the rating",0
"I clicked on an article from the Notification and the app jumped into an infinite loop of opening splash screen and close. Nothing worked, Back or Home, I had to restart my phone. Really irritating",0
There are lots of push notifications coming. So I get irritation using this app. Why should I use this application. There are a lots of apps available in Play Store based on this app.,0
Great app but sends you 6 to7 notficstion of what to read and whrn you click on them you get the message reachrd your free limit upgrade if you want to cotinue. Ithatas the case why are you fillong my notifications eith stuff I can not read. Unistalling,0
"Every article recommended to me is behind a paywall. I thought people blogged to get their stuff read and noticed, be part of the community or whatever... I don't see how this paywalled blogging model is helping them achieve it. Uninstalled",0
"Can't Sign In To App Everytime I sign in and confirm my email link, the app keeps taking me back to sign up page repeated. But if you confirm it using browser, it will open and sign me to my account. But the app doesn't.",0
"This doesn't make sense to me! Why should I pay $50 and use the app when I can read the the exact same article on your website (or other websites) for free. All I need to do is search for the article on google. *So, a person who hasn't registered with Medium and downloaded the app gets to read everything, but a person who has doesn't!!",0
"Crashes Pixel 4 XL. When links to articles open the app to read natively, the screen goes black, flickers, and gets stuck in this state. Only turning phone off and back on resolves the problem.",0
"A subscription is required to read material. My ""monthly limit was exceeded"" when trying to read something, despite not reading anything the whole month. Frustrating for sure, uninstalled.",0
"Email link for signing up only last fifteen minutes. Email takes longer than that to arrive. Ridiculous. And no, I don't want to sign in via Google or FB.",0
Articles are behind pay wall. Unable to read without paying,0
"It requires payment to read even a short How To article,",0
The number of articles one can read in a month is very small! The app constantly keeps on reminding you about the max number of articles I can read under the free tier! Disappointed!,0
Medium is unable to show me or notify me about new articles published by the one (yes 1) person that I follow. Instead my home page shows me a stream of constant drivel.,0
"I rated it 5 stars until I realised that most content offered is basically an ad for the ludicrously expensive premium membership, and without it, you get your time wasted since there is no way to hide non free content. Not everyone lives in a rich, highly developed Western country. For you people, five bucks might be half an hour of work or less, but for us, it's three hours. You clearly don't want our business, like most companies who don't adjust prices according to region.",0
Uninstalled it. Has gotten really aggressive with notifications for stories I don't want to read. When I say no. I mean it. Thank you!,0
"Ridiculous. I read 3 articles and then told I needed to pay to open anything else. Signed up then deleted account and app in the space of ten minutes, not even enough access to look around properly. What a joke.",0
"Ended up uninstalling this app because it doesn't respect choosing to open a medium article in the browser. If I'm presented with an option to open a link in the browser or a specific app, and i choose to open it in the browser, the app should respect that choice and not force me to use the app",0
"Limited reads is fine. But once the article is accessed, it should always be open. This model of hard upgrading just destroys a pleasant user interface. Edit-Not on Reddit.",0
"I wish I could give it zero stars. It never catered itself to what/how I like to read, regardless of the content I preferred, I was always bombarded by negative information. I mean demonic level negativity. Women gladly cheating before and after their marriage, men spending more time in hobbies than with their children, etc. I'm finished.",0
"Looks beautiful. Everyone sounds like an expert, but everything they say is nonesense.",0
Subscription - is the worst thing you could possibly do with the app and with the platform itself. A lot of writers and experts already moved to another platforms. You have to do something with it.,0
You can't read anything without getting that premium membership. Really hate that.,0
Worst app don't download if you want same App then go for qoura app,0
I can read unlimited articles online but when I download your app I can read five a month. Absolute trash !!,0
"Can sign up to the app via email, as the app uses a wierd font color/background color combination that makes it impossible for human eyes to read the error text(or something else that hinders my sign up)",0
people atleast keep that paywall an option for those would like to opt out of advertisements ....yes you can run adds for those who dont wanna pay.. but u cannot force with a paywall... there are better options so yes im uninstalling 🤨,0
This was a great app. But as of now alld the content is locked behind their paywall. The number of free content has reduced so much that I can't see myself using this anymore.. Uninstalling,0
"I was misled, from the Medium app, to send a feedback email instead of leaving a negative review here. Medium is paywalled, i.e. you have to pay a monthly subscription to read some (or all?) articles - I don't know, it's unclear. The whole thing smells like a scam.",0
Don't bother installing unless you want to purchase a membership right away.. you can read ONE premium blog and then they charge you for anything more...just stick to the website.,0
Almost all articles locked for premium membership. it's really disappointing to see the platform become so limited especially since it used to be my go to place for reading.,0
"The app is quite good in itself, but it keeps wanting me to pay to read articles that I can freely read in the browser. Going to uninstall and just use the browser. Shame.",0
Failed to create account with yahoo mail. It sent verification mail but clicking link and copy past link both tried Link when pasted the window disappear. If link opened in application medium it self it again repetadely asking name and email And again sending activation mail. Chain reaction Please improve so that we can know what's inside,0
"I do not like the fee for reading ""free"" articles",0
For some reason this app started showing a notification that doesn't have any text in it and I can't swipe it away. Closing the app didn't remove it either. Had to block notifications completely.,0
"Can't get past sign up screen. When an app won't let you take a look around without having to sign up first? That's a huge strike against it and a great reason to delete the app off my phone. I don't care who you are, that kind of arrogance should not be tolerated. Uninstalled.",0
"Was intruiged by this app, and downloaded it last nite. Opened it up just now, and on the very 1st article I opened, was informed that I had reached the end of my 'free monthly quota, and please subscribe to read on'. Will be deleting it now.",0
The App is interesting and seems useful if you purchase upgraded version then after you use this app else it is waste of time you won't able to read full articles hope this is helpful who is looking to download this app.,0
"Paid content after only a few articles. This is a hidden feature until you've already exceeded your limit. Very dodgy, don't appreciate the secrecy. I also can't imaging that the money I'm paying is going to the contributors either.",0
"Obtrusive notifications. Keeps recommending content about topics multiple times marked as ""not interested"". Requires payments to read more than few articles. Desperate attempt to monetize content created by community for free.",0
The beta is *awful* and will kill my medium usage. Please don't do this.,0
"Horrible.. Medium was considered to be a good platform to read out stuffs from our interests but since they have limited their free stories per month, no one in my group and work likes the app, earlier we use to share stories related to things we are working and now we share links of other stuffs because the same kind of stuffs are available at other resources as well ,it was the readability that made us use this app but they are hitting axe on their own feet by monetizing lyk this,bye bye 4ever",0
"I'm trying to read an article but when I click on it, it crashes. I tried so many times but facing same issue. Can you guys fix it soon.",0
i have an android ..it was working fine 2 days ago stopped working...I keep getting a message that medium has stopped right well I'm trying to download pics and publish..please help I'm trying to complete writing that I have done,0
Most of the articles are only for premium users. Pay to read app.,0
"Always ask to download the App but when I download it I can't even read a paragraph I have to pay $50 a year just to read. Thank you, I understand why you asked me to use the App. I just uninstalled it.👎",0
Social / email signup is not working.Only white screen is showing. This is blocking me entering into this app. I wonder how this version passed QA test ? Kudos to the team.,0
"This app used to be awesome and then predatory pricing and pay schemes kicked in. You get 3 free articles and then you need to upgrade to ""membership"" to view more content. uninstalled. unsubscribe.",0
Pay for free content after three articles!!! This app was designed with intention to push subscription of medium by blocking content just after few articles. Dont download please.,0
The app did not load an article when opening from Chrome and instead got stuck on the splash screen.,0
The new logo is so weird,0
I found no means to comment on the article I read. It is now uninstalled.,0
The web version is free for all but they are limiting the number of posts one can view in the app ! Why should I then use the App ?,0
The app shows all the paid articles along with free ones and then asks users to pay. Can the developers have a simple switch which allows users not to see paid stories at all and read only free ones? Is that too much to ask? If it is then I will uninstall the app immediately,0
"Really like the platform but night mode is useless. The double mirage effect during reading, pretty much makes it a eye sore. I enjoy the web platform but mobile display version needs work. Thank you",0
"The app designed to push you to pay for an account to read stories. There is no easy way to just see the posts of people I follow or simply find the free content. Therefore, I am uninstalling it.",0
"This app only allows you to read first 3 or 5 articles after that you have to pay. Why would someone pay, when there are many free resources available. Uninstalling after this comment!",0
"One rating is for the paid subscription. Its not really worth paying $4-5 per month, some other site will take over the userbase once they provide the clean interface like medium does!",0
"Unable to login! Every time it sends me an email, I get stuck in an infinite loop. Medium is great, but I'm completely unable to login with this app.",0
"I installed this app without realizing that Medium is a subscription service. The value offered by medium does not justify a subscription, just generate ad revenue like other media.",0
let's you read an article or two then requires you to pay $5 per month or $50 a year. loaded with advertisements altogether a disappointment. uninstalled!,0
While I was trying to figure out the app.. it prompted to buy subscription. Not all articles are good. If you read books a lot of those articles are from there. I have to uninstall it now.,0
App glitched when opening and I cannot open ANY apps on my phone after restarting. Was told by phone company customer service that I have to wipe phone and start over. I will not be reinstalling Medium's app.,0
I installed app today. Really liked articles..so I started reading. After 4-5 articles it's says 'you read a lot. Upgrade now' What is wrong with you guys???,0
One of the best articles anywhere on the internet with the best UI and design..... Absolutely stupid that you have to pay and pay that much.,0
"Seems to have good articles, shame it can't be read without a pricey subscription. Even Economist magazine doesn't charge that much.",0
"used to be a great reading app, now is not free, I wouldn't mind a small banner at the bottom or like at the beggining of the article to pay for server costs and all",0
not an app but publishing rules behind this platform is terrible. think twice when you plan to publish a fair article. they can easily ban your article even if it would comply with freedom of expression terms without given a one proper reason.,0
You basically have to pay for every single thing in this app. At least make it 10 or 20 articles per month so that people could become engaged with your app and decide to upgrade.,0
"0/5. This app is just ridiculously stupid . I downloaded this app in hopes of getting some science and technology oriented articles, and even though I picked only those interest in the app, the only articles that were shown were ""editor pick"" extreme left propaganda articles! Why??",0
"App is called medium but I'd rate it not just 'low'', but a resounding 'hell no' cus it wants you to pay for what you otherwise can read for free (in the browser).",0
"PATHETIC APP! 1st you can only view 2-3 articles a month. 2nd they force your personal feed with articles you have to pay for. 3rd its a rip off app, i rather read articles on chrome for free. The only articles i can find are the ones you have to pay to read. Ridiculous money making app. Dont Download. Medium use to be great when it was free for majorty articles and you only paid for a premium article...now its just Bad.",0
"not very good. It seems to provide you with many innocuous stories from people and publications you never heard of or care about. As one review stated, you have to upgrade to a fee based service to read just about 95% of the articles, and this is true. I will be removing this app.",0
"Be careful with paid subscription for 1 year. There's impossible to refund, even if cancelled the subscription. Terrible app, with to much low content",0
"useless, as if you don't upgrade you wont be able to see the contents. the first 2 or 3 lines are not enough. same for the website",0
"Love the app ,but not the pricing ! If only for India ,as we have per capital income is low and there is a competitor like Quora,if it can be priced at 99 per month or 999 for year ,I am sure a flood of people will get subscription ! Please slash pricing !",0
Sad what medium has become. From being one of the best reading experiences to now we have nag screens and paywalls. its hard to read even non pay wall content with the screen taken up but non relevant dialogs.,0
"While Medium presents itself as an open platform for bloggers and writers, the curators only share stories that are left leaning. I posted a few articles from my Evangelical Christian perspective that met the criteria in order to be shared by the curators but they refused to share them. Just do a search on their website in the religion and politics sections and you'll quickly see how biased towards the left the curators are. If this isn't discrimination, I honestly don't know what is.",0
"For every article it's asking for membership, sorry still I'm not yet able to pay that expenses, i need free version atleast with images disabled",0
"I didn't like this app, just now installed when I wanted to read asking for upgrade🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Quora is better than this. It's simply loosing interest of learning bcz of this premium options😠😠😠",0
"Even if you have already downloaded the article, it still lost the image on the article once you lost the internet. Useless app in place without internet connection",0
I love medium app. it's easy to navigate and has great content from great writers. Thanks to the team who made this possible. Thank you for shinning the light of your creativity on humanity so that others can see through.,0
Why does the app keep sending me back to the signup screen even when my credentials are correct? why does it keep telling me the email confirmatory link has expired so soon?,0
"Unfortunately, one of those apps where at first you thought nice app with great readings, but without any warning it just informe you after few articles that you have to subscribe to go on.",0
I brought a medium paid subscription for the audio experience but when i switch to Audio section in my app it just keeps loading without showing me any article. My phone is Samsung Note 8. Can you please fix this issue or refund my money back?,0
I hate it not only that it kept telling me your unable to get in when the password i have been using the whole time was not working.,0
Why I have to upgrade to read the daily articles. First you are suggesting us to read and the when go to read ask for upgrade. Unistallalling this app now. Thanks,0
"frustrating that it uses what you've read to then show you more of the same,i'd prefer to just see posts by category in date order.",0
All of the 100s of articles on the home page are premium articles. And then The Medium Corp will say they don't display ads. Wow.,0
Better specify the limits of the application. You're not allowed to read after 2 or 3 or 5 articles in a month unless you buy the subscription.,0
"The price is too high for memberships. If you want to monetize the app, just add advertisements.",0
"It's great a platform, if you're a lefty and love reading garbage posted by left-loving authors who need their safe spaces. Just don't post anything critical about the author, because Medium will flag your account.",0
"For a story telling app, which requires you to pay money for reading stories. Now that is not at all a decent app.",0
"Worst idea to introduce subscription based content reading. Cheap and stupid are the app owners! Had to come here before uninstalling, so that this comment helps other users.",0
"after the latest update, it doesn't load anything. the home page is blank. please fix this",0
The free trial only lasts a day. I literally only downloaded this app yesterday and now it's charging me? Please fix this.,0
This app is a waste of time. You can hardly sign in with your email through the link they send in your email. I installed it today morning but i've uninstalled it.,0
"Medium App makes Facebook worse. Try to comment on a Medium article while in Facebook, and the moment.you move into FB, the article disappears forever. Search of key words is useless. Zero stars.",0
Why do I have to create an account when I can view medium pages online without logging into anything? Why can't I view things in the app anonymously in the same way?,0
Screw this I have better things to do then keep going back and fourth between my gmail and entering my gmail address this thing is redicules I'm uninstalling right now. I really hate it when small things suck up my time.,0
The app kept telling me I read too much and that I should upgrade. I haven't read anything on medium lately so I am sick of this message. Uninstall and unsubscribe from email.,0
Why does your app mess up every possible image that is uploaded on it?! Please compare how medium renders images on chrome and on the app and do something about it.,0
"I was sent an article and could only read a paragraph or two before the relentless squeeze for dollars started. My email is overloaded with articles I could read after I pay. No thanks, no way !",0
Subscription fees is too high for the quality of feed they provide,0
why are you showing me articles from 2016 and 2017 first on my news feed in this app?! Truly crazy and absolutely clueless. Going to give this app and my new subscription to the service 24hrs to blow my mind. otherwise will unsubscribe. Only subscribed to access Mark Bittmans 'Salty' but thats not enough of a draw to get sucked into an article thats 3 years old!,0
"I can't update, Medium. When I reach 88% of downloading, suddenly the updated stop. I don't know why. Help!",0
More then half of the articles on my feed were blocked by a paywall. App does even sbow which ones ar epaid and not paided. Spent more time hitting back from a preimum article than reading arricles themselves.,0
"Tried to use it twice on a note 9, both times it won't let me log in, just takes me back to the sign up page.",0
It became really annoying recently by automatically taking over articles from the browser. Totally eleminating the user's choice.,0
Very bad. I write and take a long time but i can't publish it. And my stories isn't save as draft... I spend so much time just for typing but nothing,0
Just didn't really like it... Think I only got the app because I couldn't comment on the mobile web interface. Never go to the website anyways.,0
"This deceptive app is disinformation. It is a blatant attempt to spread false, inaccurate, untrue and offensively biased articles which seem designed to brainwash and deceive gullible readers. This app is clearly a partisan political tool and should be obliged to display a warning to that effect.",0
Used to be good. Now cant even share articles. Clicking on share option gives some title of article instead of link.,0
The 2 sec old link that is required to finish account registration is said to be expired. Tried resending the link 3 times. Same issue each time,0
Not login why?,0
"Every time I opened an article from google discovery, the app always flickered to keep open and close endlessly until I turn off. This bug is horrible.",0
Can't sign up. Can't use without signing up. Broken experience. Can't understand why half the apps couldn't solve the sign up problem.,0
used to have great content my go to place to read articles now asks me to upgrade if I try to read any post . Medium has now lost its charm moving to other platforms like reddit,0
I thought it was free.. no need to pay to read blogs no added value ! try to add some useful features.,0
I had the premium which they shutdown for no reason. It shows in my subscription list but i can't read any starred article :(,0
"I get notifications for Medium posts which are by influencers, I can look at five them need to pay - the only medium posts that are promoted are the ones I'll need to pay for, far from the amazing platform it once was",0
"App is terrible, articles are 5000 years old. Recent ones are garbage. I'm not even American but i read an article about Tik Tok ban in USA, first they wrote its what Trump and all those in government generally wants to do. But as i read the article (I don't know whoever wrote it) was only criticizing Trump (about his whatever). This shift from general to individual criticism is a fake news. Hating someone doesn't make the article relevant. People believe it. Its terrible. Negative quality app.",0
"Requires sign up, without explaining why. Poorly designed ad placeholders. Really inferior compared to website.",0
"It has a limit of like 5-7 articles a month, if you want more, you ll ha e to buy membership. This was not mentioned in description",0
"The one article I downloaded this app for had the incorrect link and continuously went to ""web page not found"" page. What a massive waste of time.",0
"i had to subscribe after a short while, in order to keep using this thing. i didn't even read many articles on here and they want my money. uninstalled. I'll just read on my browser instead.",0
I can't login. It sends me an email but the link doesn't go anywhere I've had 5 so far and it hasn't logged me in,0
"Clicking stories from Google now leads to an endless cycle of opening in Medium app, opening in Chrome, Medium, Chrome . . .",0
Shows only the articles which can be read by members only. My feed is filled with them. The free ones are not shown on my feed. Pathetic,0
Can't read any of the articles without buying premium.,0
It was great until the stupid subscription model came along. How is it possible that 80% of my suggestions are member only stories?,0
"Tried four times to create an account. ""Sorry link expired"" each time. Literally clicked the link right away. Save your time.",0
"Bugs 1.Viewing a profile shows loading screen. But it doesn't load. 2.I have to click the share button ""twice"" to get the share menu.",0
Horrible. Keeps shutting down just before I get to the end and won't let me finish the story. SO frustrating!!!,0
This app seriously sucks ass! You're limited to only 3 reads a month and most of the content on here is click bait titles with garbage filler writing. You click on the interesting title and waste a limited read on garbage.,0
Home page only contain premium article.. given 1 star because the contents and design is very good,0
"Medium widget won't display on any of my phones despite having a subscription. Says ""problem loading widget"". Is this a current bug?",0
I read a lot and always asks for payment. So I chose to uninstall the application. I believe knowledge should be shared free of cost.,0
"I tried to log in, it said they'd send me an email with a ""magic link"" 🙄. I got the email, clicked the link, it opened the app and said it couldn't log me in.",0
I always run out of preview somehow without having read anything in the month. Will open each article in incognito from now on.,0
Couldn't sign in at all.. Received several verification emails and none of the button worked. Now I'm finally in somehow but it keeps loading forever.,0
Serious waste. Don't bother. Wants you to pay to read stories that are easily accessible on other apps. Only lets you read a couple of articles before demanding money,0
"Rubbish, plugged into Google, doesn't work without Google services...",0
Terrible UX! Scrolling jumps to the top of the article every time! Very disappointing for a paying user. I'm unsubscribing now.,0
"Enjoy reading three articles, not being able to mark something as not interesting, and being asked to rate only if you enjoyed it.",0
No use of this app if you are not ready to PAY for blog content which the same you can read for free in browser... didn't find much use other than GET A LINK and read in browser.. APP < BROWSER,0
There are lot of articles which are interesting to read but unfortunately they are limiting it by only let me read few articles per month.and they charge us for more when we are logged in with our user account 😏😏,0
worst app to study. technical things. Very in depth topics of machine learning are written in very amateur. way. Use this app just for time pass.(Writing this post after one month of its usage),0
Articles in my area of interest are majority of times superficial and unstructured. Also most are now under paid option which has started popping up more often. Uninstalling.,0
"Bugs, unable to view saved stories offline even though I have a paid subscription. Support did not do anything to fix.",0
"I ask to follow 2 people , I get every articles I don't need in home page except what I asked to follow. Uninstalled the app within 2 minutes of using it and using Chrome instead",0
seemed great but then I couldn't read any more without paying. I would rather see ads.,0
I thought it was free but then when a downloaded I could finish reading more than 2 paragraphs because it say that I have to pay ..if is really like that it's just wasting of time🤮👌,0
I love this app but too expensive for me to subscribe. hoping that you would have a one time pay membership. too sad and i need to uninstall.,0
When I opened a story and I hit back I don't return the the last app I used but on the Medium home page. This is very very annoying.,0
"Nauseating, simpering, politically correct drivel. Too bad there isn't an option for zero stars.",0
"the application did not authenticate on my phone, Motorola X4 Android One, it for some reason gives me the message, ""couldnt verify the account""",0
"Really really love the app and immense amount of knowledge it grants but hate their cost model. Being a student I'm excited to learn more stuff but everyone's gotta pay, so🤷🏾‍♂️",0
This is the most pretentious app I've ever used. The design language is ambitious until how ugly it looks like once you start to explore the app.,0
3 measly free articles per month. It used to be unlimited. Its not worth paying for or keeping installed.,0
Never install it. This is the worst app i've ever come across. After reading just one article they say i need to upgrade my account for $5/month. Better i'd use quora for free.,0
"Now everything is behind a paywall. Uninstalled, I can still read them in a browser.",0
So limited features for non member users and very difficult to navigate.,0
"Why the hell am I supposed to pay for premium? Whatever ""premium"" articles I read here, I can read on an online browser with no charge. The subscription cost, on the other hand, is way to high.",0
medium has slowly transitioned into paydium..Every other article is paid. Not enough value in a freemium tier to switch to premium,0
"It used to be free, now you have to pay if you want to read. And guess what? There's tons of other readers I can use to read for free. And if there's an author that I like, I will donate.",0
"Free to read on browser, but pay to read on app. Amazing strategy. Keep up your business though process. Not worth for membership.",0
I can't login using Facebook. It shows a message that the app is in development mode.,0
The app was working fine but suddenly it started showing up failed to fetch new stories it's been 2 days and it's still the same,0
Uninstalled first thing they want is your email address. Seriously why? We all know why. Newsbreak doesn't require that.,0
I wont pay for articles that I can find for free. never. i will come back when it becomes free to use - never.,0
The threshold for free membership is garbage.,0
"Excelent app and concept, except for the scummy cash grab.",0
Not worth it only 3 or 4 free articles in a Month!,0
Medium made it impossible to open links to its site without this app. This is terrible practice.,0
It was all good until the content was free. Articles aren't worthy paying a monthly fee.,0
You should first solve your login issues on your app. Just a waste of time after recieving email when click on Link again a login problem occured. Is this just fro some spam ?,0
"Great app, until it keeps drawing you in to constantly ask for money.",0
"three article a month is a joke, and premium prices are out of budget for indians like me, love the community, but hate the money model, i left no choice than to find a workaround or uninstall, help..!",0
Such a useless application. Installed it thinking of growing my knowledge .. but after reading one single article I can't read any other because of its 50$ subscription.. Such a dick sucking developers.. Hated it and Unistalled.😠,0
"Bug that scrolls article back to top for no apparent reason while trying to scroll down makes app unusable, specially for longer articles.",0
I got the information about the riptrex exchange on this platform which is medium itself which was a cryptocurrency exchange.....I put a huge amount of 5 bitcoin on this exchange as it was advertised on medium app and the exchange flew away with my huge amount......now I am on road.,0
"The in-app purchase appears to be the app itself, but it is not listed as a paid app. This may be fraud.",0
"Too many premium articles and too little free ones, app pretty much forces you to buy subscription.",0
Free version but few access. This is a good app for students to read and being inspired by nevermind. I wish I can give no star at all.,0
Links from google now/home (side screen) does not open in medium app. It goes to the home page of medium app,0
Paid reading subscription is required to read more than 10 articles per month. Usless application.,0
"Garbage. Another example of woke media giving you one side of the story to further the narrative that racism is run rampant in America. Comments can only be left by members who are ""woke"" enough. Ignorant to the fact that the vicious people you are defending will care less when your publication is dead & gone!",0
this app is great and love to use but they provide only little post to read for FREE . As I am a student and really support their idea but their price much more .,0
Why can't you release series feature on android why only for iOS and web. Android is the biggest in terms of marketshare in mobile OS and should not be treated as a second class platform.,0
They are pushing for the subscription by enforcing that I reached monthly limits. But I'm pretty sure that I have never read anything more than 5 articles.,0
"Can only read one article, rediculous. Its better to use incognito browser mode, that lets you view all articles, this app is useless",0
Medium not getting open through link. I am using paid version and this problem is consistent for last 3 weeks atleast,0
All the articles need subscription now. Can't read anything without upgrading the account anymore.,0
I can't read any recommendations because I don't have subscription and I don't want to subscribe so please stop daily recommendations.Tell me if there is a way to find out whether article is free or paid before opening it.,0
Can't even log in. It jus kicks me out as soon as I try to. Terrible app. 1/5,0
Before was good. Now it's practically useless unless you subscribe and pay.,0
Very sad that i have to pay subscription to read an article. I can understand that end of the day it's just business and it's a company but still you can let some budding developers to learn for free,0
"Category content issue, i get confuse which is my choice of caregory? as it shows so many categories content in mixed. I want it to be Solved by just show me only my selected category content 😑",0
"Useless install, got to read 3 measly articles before it locked me out, underhanded way to get people to install, deleting and not recommended",0
"Use a browser instead. Then you have no annoying notifications, can read things offline and have no limit in articles you can read.",0
Stupid app. The purpose of this app is to limit you to 2 reads per month. Was better before their lame business model.,0
Installed the app once and now I receive plenty of spam mails from medium from which I can not unsubscribe from or disable them in the app settings.,0
Please add a scroll bar so that user can know the page length. Thanks!,0
I have a problem to open my account. Just reload but not open. I don't know what the reason is! Thanks,0
"i just uninstalled it. why would I pay to download the stories to my phone, if i can do that on chrome? Bad business model. Just push ads and provide a download and bookmark option",0
It's surprising that the partner program for writers is still limited to just 30 countries!,0
"Unlike their website and unlike other journal and news apps, requires to you sign in with an account.  Even just to see the 5 free articles per month.  Uninstalled.",0
Very interesting articles but it's very bothering that is barely mentioned that you have to pay in order to read more articles,0
"Lately, dashboard only filled with premium articles. Can't read anything without upgrading.",0
"Medium has some good technical articles I really like. But every day they keep pushing racial articles meant to divide people, pitting one race against another. I mute the authors and channels, but they keep forcing divisive content. I paid for a year of this service. Stop spreading the hate.",0
As always it's starts off great and then suddenly you can't read anything unless you pay.,0
"great for writers, but the cost is high. increase the number of reads to 10.",0
I had been a huge advocate of Medium. But I am highly disappointed by seeing such a huge push for only premium content.,0
"just a simple reader. the web version does the same, but suffers from the annoying popups for this app.",0
Subscription notifications are too aggressive. Provides low value on free tier and wastes time and attention. Uninstalled from phone.,0
"Need paid subscription to access articles, and since most writers on site are not paid, the money is only going to the developers, not the people who create the content.",0
so bad that the application become inaccessible cause i must pay .. i used to be a medium members since the app launched and now i am not cause the developers put the money before the clint .. thank you for your miss,0
Samsung S8. Bug where the screen tilts ad infinitum when clicking on a medium link that open the app.,0
allows for about 30 minutes of content per month before a subscription is needed,0
This app has great content but it works out only for premium members. They dont even provide ten free articles to read,0
Couldn't read any article because everything is paid. Atleast allow people to read a few things before asking them to buy your membership.,0
"The library is of far higher quality, and far lower price.",0
It's a scam. You need to buy premium membership to read more than 4 articles per month. I mean why bother. Just make this a paid app or subscription based right from the start.,0
Deeplinking is completely broken. Gave me an infinite loop when opening articles. No fix yet,0
ads pop-up and can't be closed. I prefer the web page over the app.,0
Am happy to be on medium app and I appreciate your services . Thank You So Much To Build This App,0
"FUMING. I specifically signed up for the $5 a month option and when I did, it took me back to the subscribe page and had charged me 50! I'm very low wage and absolutely CAN NOT afford this. It left me with $60 in my account and I have a huge bill coming in 3 days. I specifically hit the 5 a month and triple checked before going to paypal. Is this Mediums way of taking money hoping we dont notice???? I am positively SEETHING. I want my money back on my PayPal and changed to 5 a month.",0
unable to resolve in app purchase issue. 3 payments charged thru Vodafone pay services yet no access to paid service. no roll back possible from Vodafone. pls resolve,0
Download 1 GB of mobile data in one minute. Uninstalled. Better stay with web version.,0
"Not free, way too restrictive for a passive user",0
Stopped working today. Just flashes the entire screen black and white whenever I open it.,0
"Can't save articles to read offline. Have updated the app, but no luck!",0
It was full of great stuff! but a paywall appearead as soon as my interest got momentum.,0
Good content. But everything is behind an expensive pay-wall.,0
"It use to be free, now beside the countless add's you have to pay for it.",0
Now unusable for free. App only recommends premium articles even though it knows I am not a premium member.,0
I tried this app and deleted it unless you become a paid member you get 3 articles to read for the month,0
"It was a great app, now with the subscription fees it's almost impossible to use it again",0
Home page doesn't show articles from the interests you've followed. Renders the entire app useless because all I see is garbage I have no interest in.,0
"Pathetic. Inspite if subscribing, it asks for details again and again, log ins Everytime when accessing articles. Bad bad experience.",0
The pay wall finally became too much. I have plenty of services tugging at my sleeve for subscriptions.,0
GIFs on articles don't play. (ex: Muzli's UI Interactions of the Week),0
"almost 90% content is paid. if i can read only 1 story from my homescreen, what's point of having app.",0
They asking to upgrade to premium accounts for almost every article now.,0
"I can't open or search for any, it just show loading page and stop.",0
They keep suggesting membership only articles when I'm not interested in paying for a membership. Uninstalled.,0
"This app sucks really bad for technical articles!!! Try yourself to see demonstrations of code, command line intructions, etc...",0
"payed for subscription, however offline reading mode doesnt work. Mate 20 Pro",0
I love the constant warning that you can't read anything because your monthly limit has been reached. Novel idea... Biggest waste of time ever,0
You need to get yourself a monthly subscription if you want to use this app regularly. Not the best way to encourage buyers.,0
Unclear how to unsubscribe. You're making it near impossible to unsubscribe. AND to stop my subscription fee. Why???,0
"Medium is a waste of time, money and effort. This content is present at other sites for free. Moreover, I was misdirected to this site while attempting to view an episode of Project Blue Book... Yeah, go figure!",0
This app gives just one day trail to read for free. Apps like Quora which provide similar features at free of cost are way better than this,0
Lol.... I downloaded wrong app. I think that i can read articles for free here. Actually i can not to do that. I have to pay monthly or yearly subscription to read those articles.,0
Why is the app not working?? I am from Bangladesh. And I can't log in through the app,0
Most of the posts these days seem to require premium membership.,0
now behind a paywall. if you want to read anything you have to pay for a subscription. uninstalled.,0
The app made absolutely sure to let me know that Trump is an American idiot. I'm not even american I don't care about trump and I've dismissed that article so many times but it just keeps popping up in my notifications. Keep your politics away from my notifications please,0
I can't merge my account with the correct email; been a member for a year and only have member status on my tablet.,0
It's horrible to force writers and push them to put their articles behind a pay wall. I am deleting the app from my phone. Account deletion will follow.,0
Good app form learning but atleast reading articles should be free upgrade should be available for other features not even to read articles,0
The free version doesn't show any articles. I don't liked that so I uninstalled the application.,0
"cant read without upgrading, will continue to use browser for medium instead.",0
can only read the first paragraph of each story. if you go back it gets marked as read.,0
it is a shame not allowing us to go reading unless we upgrade to premium,0
Unable to login on my samsung tab e. Model SM T561,0
Its a paid app. All good articles leads to upgrade and payment. Don't waste time it ur not looking for paid information in todays free world,0
Paying a subscription to read the articles that I can read via a web browser seems absolutely ridiculous.,0
Why do I have to leave an article to edit settings. And how do I stop using the crappy in app browser... and just open it in FireFox?!,0
Prro model. No content without Paid subscription. That's pretty poor in 2019.good content should be free to access.,0
"When adding new interests, the content of the home page doesn't change.",0
"paywalls can **** off, especially when I can access the articles for free from desktop",0
The whole pay to read a blog post modal sucks. I wish more publishers would ditch Medium.,0
trouble signing in. please allow us to sign in with passwords instead of sign in link sent to our email because those links don't even work,0
"Nothing for free, you to buy each, and everything",0
"Terrible UI. I hate scrolling in this app. Bars popping out and in, makes for a really bad reading experience.",0
The verification email only gave a blank screen... Could not get verified...,0
"What the fawking hell?! I haven't even finished checking some articles and it says I've exhausted my reading quota? I hadn't even spent more than fifteen minutes on this app and now I have to pay? Oh no! No, I won't. Not that easily. This is just click bait. Uninstalling... Now.",0
Not able to open the app. It is repeatedly showing sign up and sign in screens that's it.,0
"Not a free app, requires a membership amd monthly payments. The website is however free so this app is an insulting money grab.",0
Asked for upgrade too soon. Paid app for something that should be free,0
Too little content is free to view and makes using the app like a giant click bait adventure.,0
Lots of content.. not worth paying for! Good luck Medium,0
It's a paid app. You can't read any article fully without upgrading by payment.,0
You've reached the end of your free application rating. Upgrade for 5 star review access. Only 5$ for 5 star / month,0
"Bad in at least two ways: 1/ keeps reminding me that I have only N free articles left this month. I do not plan to pay to read blog posts on Medium, so I'd rather encourage my friends writing on this plateform to switch to another platform. 2/ Directs us to write comment/rating on the Play store only if we answer ""yes"" to the question ""Do you like the Medium app"", leading to biased ratings on the Play store.",0
Only paid articles now. No option to searchbjust free articles.,0
Unable to login. Verification links keeps expiring in seconds,0
"too expensive, 50 dollars a year for mainly text, no strain on their servers",0
Paying for reading articles by upgrade at this age of competition... Uninstalled successfully.,0
"Only has like 6 stories, rarely updates and gets stuck loading.",0
"It was good, until they asked me to upgrade to premium to use the app. Instantly uninstalled it.",0
When I cant read an article because of free membership I simply close the application and open the browser so what do we use the app for?! I donk know.,0
Infinite loading loop glitch android 8.1. Will be cancelling subscription.,0
can only read a couple of stories a MONTH. must be a joke. absolutely ridiculous.,0
UNABLE TO BUY SUBSCRIPTION i tried 2 times paying for its subscription using my visa card however the payment was debited from the account but it was declined by Google payment,0
Started charging. Lost their way. Time to leave. There are now better free alternatives. A shame.,0
Limited reading so it's useless to me. Don't want to selectively choose things to read.,0
Uninstalling because all the good content is now behind a paywall. No use for the App now.,0
"I have never read anything today, and the application says that I have finished my free reading dose !!",0
"Uninstall, You read, you need subscription Just reduce your user, put ads Instead",0
"Medium gets so popular because its peoples content. Having to pay a fee is absurd! Are you not producing the content, so keep it free!",0
whenever I open medium link from browser its redirecting to medium app....and its crashing....,0
"It's totally can't publish any story, because the verification email never received!",0
For the low low price of 5 dollars a month you too can read the wise words of every jobless ammature in your field trying to boast their resume and land that first job. Woot. Surely disappointed by the cop out of ads and move to paywalls. And daily suggestions for articles locked behind these walls in the form of notifications to my phone is causing me to say goodbye for good. Good luck with monetization and try not to get too aggressive. Update: site seems to be a great medium for piracy...,0
Every article requires a stupid ass membership. I'm not paying to read an article. Not now. Not ever. Uninstalling.,0
"Freeze at splash screen, only able to force close the app",0
"I read an article and tapped ""clap"", and now Medium ONLY shows me more articles from that author. How am I supposed to discover new content if they only show me articles from one author? I really wish tech companies would abandon the ""tailored content"" algorithms; it leads to a limited worldview and terrible groupthink. Uninstalled.",0
Annoying.... It blocks user from reading with limit criteria and ask to upgrade,0
Unable to read article. Everytime its says upgrade .,0
"Only because it's paid... I'm not able to read more than one paragraph of article of my interest, it really sucks.",0
I have made a purchase for subscription. Even my money also gots deduct from my card but It still shows buy subscription. They are looting peoples,0
"Oh so if i read thru the ""convenient"" app i need to pay for a subscription?! however browser reading is free. no thanks uninstalling",0
Stop pushing for subscription. I can't even find a free article on my home anymore.,0
App hangs and slow to load articles after the recent update,0
constant alerts. impossible to turn everything off apparently,0
Way too many starred paid articles that you find it difficult reading free articles.,0
Most of the articles that show up in home are membership only articles.,0
Story titles aren't displaying when I browse interests. Android 7 Moto G4 plus.,0
I keep reinstall the app for three months these days.. Make me crazy in reinstall again and again!,0
Free the you have to pay! Not a true free app. Why pay when there are so many apps that do this for free?,0
Most of the recommendation is of premium articles,0
Absolutely useless to download this app when you could access all their 'premium' content via the web.,0
The membership system is the Worst way of asking people for money. Period.,0
"sneaky. Medium recruits you to be a contributor, then surprises you with requiring you to pay to be a reader, after a time",0
"if I want to continue my article, it tells me to upgrade, I'm really annoyed",0
"Dont bother downloading this app. You get to read a few articles of dubious interest....and then it just wants you to purchase a ""membership"".",0
The app starts blinking continuously when I go to a medium link from a different applicqtion,0
"Prompted for login though logged in. Also, not stable to open either in mobile app or website",0
Would be great if everything didn't revolve around premium.,0
"It's a worst app, it will pop up middle of the reads while reading through other chanel. Stupidity.",0
Every other article is paid..Make it a fully paid app. Going to uninstall it..Waste of time,0
The offline articles do not save the media (GitHub snippet).,0
"When I click medium links, the app opens and flickers uncontrollably.",0
"This app refuses to be updated, I can't access any of my post on the previous version.",0
"I didn't read for 15 min. before ya' want money. It didn't strike me as informative enough to pay anyway. Same stuff,, , , different app......",0
What pathetic app...every article asks for membership ...why is it an app anyway ..it should be a paid magazine...sick . I do not recommend it to anyone who thinks they let u read for free. Thoroughly disappointed,0
Most of the articles are no more free. Don't download.,0
"I m not able to read any article, from first day it is asking for buying paid membership",0
uanble to read storys.pricing too high content quality is low..,0
"Really painful, keeps asking for subscriptions all the time",0
Honestly don't even mark this app as free it took me like 3 articles before stumbling in a huge 50$ paywall,0
"Why would someone want to keep this app when they just won't stop forwarding you FAKE MEDIA ARTICLES. As they endorse those, I want to be light years away from them. SPREAD the WORD. Don't let your friends and peers be fooled by Medium.",0
"not able to read any article, after clicking any article the app closes.",0
no ability to download article for offline use.,0
"I was told it was free, but I got deceived. The developer is dishonest, for short.",0
All articles recommended require a subscription.,0
"I'm tired of applications trying to force me to vote on / review their apps via pop-up windows. So from now on, any app that engages in this annoying behavior gets ONE STAR.",0
You cannot view any articles without upgrading. So disappointing.,0
29-May-2019 update... Major update is added more bugs to existing app.. 😠🤦,0
All articles are for premium..no article is free.,0
"I only read 3 articles and I've ""reached the end of my free member preview for this month""? So, I can just read 3 articles a month? Is this a joke?",0
I used to enjoy reading the occasional good post for free. Certainly not worth what they're asking for now,0
Could not sign up. Click on link in mail and nothing happens,0
profile is not loading! only circular loading is shown,0
Chose my favorite topics and the first article was about Trump. Don't need an app for that.,0
"Everytime you scroll through six articles, there is only one article that is free to read. Don't waste your time if you don't want to pay to read.",0
$50/Year or $5/ Month! That's what it comes down to!,0
Cant download. Hangs at 80%,0
terrible .. loved it until they blocked me from every article until I pay $5 a month.... and now they won't quit sending me bleeps about interesting stuff....DIGITAL DIVIDE..ANYONE....ANYONE??????,0
rubbish. thought this was free. only get couple of lines then payment is requested !!!,0
Asking for upgrade too often is really annoying.,0
Website charges subscription to read what users have written. Please use alternatives.,0
"I can not read any article, always asks for membership. Bad",0
"relentless pushes to pay are really annoying. I have no idea if the content is worth it, as it won't let me read anything without paying.",0
Sign up just to see if I want to use the app! This is why I use disposable email,0
"give me ads, don't forbid me from reading god damn article! uninstalling the app because it's therefore useless.",0
"Read ""Designing Back and Up Navigation"" guide and fix your app.",0
Not going to pay to read stuff which is already available on the internet on different websites. Uninstalling the app.,0
Cant read anything. Everyday blocked even if not read any article. Just force to upgrade. Is it all about money?,0
Paid per view content. It took 3min of reading before asking for my money. Not worth it.,0
"If this app worked, it would break the countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act. Too bad.",0
"account block after pay money, i have sent mail in support but didn't get reply since 1 week.",0
Initially it was good but now they are asking for money to read information. They know how to do smart business.,0
"Horrible, freezes while flashing the screen in my S9+",0
"Don't waste your time on Medium, your stories will NEVER get read. My personal blog on my own domain has been live for only 6 months and it gets more views/reads/comments than all of my posts on Medium altogether. Medium is a waste of time if you're trying to be ""heard"". It won't happen. Don't waste your time people.",0
Not at all what I expected it to be. It's a boring social media site not a fact checking site.,0
Couldn't verify account using email or direct url,0
Way too invasive. No news is worth giving up what they're asking for. Uninstalled.,0
i installed the app for the purpose of increasing knowledge.. now it's mandatory for upgrade and payment . so uninstalling the app..,0
"Won't let me sign up, says check ur inbox but there is nothing there, another junk site",0
Why limit the articles per month when I can visit the Web page? Driving users away.,0
"Reader for website asks me 5$ per month, no thank you i have chrome.",0
"Stupid app , liked the app earlier but now asks for upgrade after just 1-2 articles",0
Forces you to pay to read more stories for the month. What a joke. At least how about a day? Nah to little money for them. Selfish.,0
Impossible to read single article with free version,0
App crashing way too much if clicked on any link from Google stories,0
"paid blog posts junking up my news feeds. anything with a medium link now gets immediately ignored, just like the nyt",0
"Free on browser, paid on smartphone. Doesn't make sense.",0
paid not free at all. bad app bad company bad marketing bad. 0 star,0
limited free previews only it is a paid app think twice before installing,0
"always ask to upgrade , dont even allow to read a single article",0
Subscription? Meh. I guess it's time to uninstall. I used to enjoy this app.,0
it is not a free reading app. they'll start irritating you as soon as you download it. that is to upgrade by paying them money. just making a fool out of people.,0
"Pressing the back button should take me back to my email from the article, not into the medium feed.",0
open a link via google discover and the app crashes.,0
Doesn't work - install and just sign in loops. Uninstalled,0
Paywall. Only 3 free articles per month lol. Hard pass.,0
Used to be good platform. But they wanted to monetize others intellectual property. Shame on these people,0
Subscription to read the articles should be free.,0
Doesn't see what is the point to keep app which allows to read few articles per month. Uninstalled.,0
"""No ads"" and after 3 articels I see ads for your membership ...",0
1. No Indonesia Medium Partner Program 2. No shortcut to network article,0
Bait and switch algorithm led to very biased articles after 30 days use,0
Horrible. The app severely limits your ability to read articles. Worthless.,0
Don't get to read any articles before being hounded to upgrade.,0
I cant open any account by fb or gmail anything..... That really sucks.,0
now you are limited to reading only a handfull of articles a month without paying this app is useless... they have ruined what was a really good community.,0
Not working with my phone that use microg project. Please just let me in using simple login. Come on,0
It just keeps on showing posts that are wayyy off the topics I chose !!,0
Subscription model is bad idea,0
Doesn't mention you need to have subscription to read articles.,0
worse app for bloggers. dont use this you will get banned without futher investigation! very worst.,0
"Buggy, just flashes and never opens.",0
Horrible. I just start getting use to reading and they asked for subscription. Horrible app,0
"Useless app, it will ask for money to read articles. not recommended. waste of time.",0
Limits the number of articles you can read unless you pay.,0
"Widget looks ugly with appbar and logo, it should show only feeds",0
"Come on, not that good, that I've to take a paid subscription",0
"Tell me, if this app is only made for rich person, as it wants upgrades payments after just reading one article ...",0
Was excited to read some articles but the subscription put me off...,0
"ridiculous, same old silicon valley playbook. get as many users as you can with 'free' content then make them pay for the service. if you need money that badly get it from advertsiers. at least that i can slightly respect.",0
Love the website but hate it if someone tries to force me to sign in.,0
Practically useless if you don't pay the monthly fee.,0
"Does a terrible job of managing drafts. If I navigate away the draft disappears and it's not obvious where it went. Pop-up points to the bottom of the screen but there's nothing there. Just by touching the screen accidentally can navigate away. There's no way to cancel a draft, no way to view the article you are responding to. Dark mode is very buggy. If it works at all it may be a half hour before it kicks in. When it finally switches, your draft is lost. Works okay for reading.",0
New UI is not very stable. And also i can't search anything on it now. Every time i try to search something it says that i am not connected to the Internet. Kindly fix this issue asap,0
"Forced to install app to read articles (to sign up via email). View on app button on websites does not take you to the article within the app. And after diligently filling in 15+ of my interests, none of them were followed/saved. UI seems nice and the concept of medium is good, but if you're really going to force people out of your website, you should make sure it works on your app.",0
It used to be the go to place for any genre of articles and was really exciting and engrossing. But now it is just a commercial app. Paywalled articles everywhere. You need to be a member to read even a small how to article and let's not get started on the recommendations which are just paid articles now. I know some of my friends write excellent articles on interesting topics and publish them to be read without a membership and they are never recommended. It's a shame how apps get commercial.,0
"There are many issues with this app. 1) The clap feature doesn't work 2) Can't comment under people's stories 3) Editing my own story is uncomfortable in many ways, but I can let it slide since it is a mobile app. The first two issues need immediate attention. I read many stories a day using mobile app yet can not connect with the fellow writers which is frustrating.",0
fixed the bug of this application because every time i got warned by my phone.,0
"Should have included ""Most Recent"" filter when searching for stories to read. Please add filter function.",0
Content is really good. But the recommandation system suggest only the premium articles. I have to do search to check free one. Please improve that experience,0
"Great service, unfortunately you have to pay for it and it's not said up front. Instead Medium should put advertisements on their page to earn money.",0
"It shouldn't be needed to paid for full access to contents on the mobile platform. You can add some ads to make money, please.",0
"Not what i expected - great UI, but any user can write an article . The ones i read were horribly written and not trustworthy - this is also a paid app.",0
Repeats the same articles over and over again when you scroll down. You cannot search/filter in your reading list.,0
"Advertised as a ad free app for regular person written news, 3 stories in and I am immediately bombarded with a notification that I must pay in order to keep reading along with a request to rate.",0
"Beta version keeps crashing, and nothing is being shown on the homepage at all - since updating mistakenly to the beta !",0
"Very closed locked platform for writers, I can't even delete post I written from the app? 👎",0
The app is good. I could find every topic I wanna read....but then I got I have to get subscription.😒,0
Without subscription is 99% useless at nova days.,0
"I am a paying user, still it stops my part-browsing part-reading in the middle, and offers me a ""free trial"" !!",0
Content is monotonous abd written with the purpose to catch attention but not transmit a useful message,0
"• Notification Bell is always highlighted • Private note isn't shown in Notif.. • Show my name on top in FOLLOWING list, if that person is following me. • How to write text in Bold or italicize? • Profile, stories, etc could be put in bottom like insta or tiktok. • New story option with a (+) in center, like in tiktok. • Have 'Following' and 'For You' page, so that I can read from all the writers I follow. In current method, I'm lazy to swipe till the last person to read their article",0
"Search button is needed, like in browser version",0
Yes they don't have ads but you have to pay to read,0
"The content on the platform is good, the app itself really sucks. A friend just shared a Medium post on Facebook. I'm a paying subscriber. I click on it to open in the app. All I get is the app opening to a page that says Medium. No interface buttons. I attempt to open in Chrome; same result, it directs me to the title page of Medium. Medium, please fix this.",0
"Design, ease of use, good. Bad: 1. It is not OK to opt in people for your junkmail (newsletters, stories, notifications). When I want those, I open the app, I don't need you spamming in my mailbox by default. And don't tell me ""You can turn it off"". That is not the point and you know it. 2. Why the hell am I receiving US politics news in my daily read? My preferences were Data science, AI, SpaceX and technology, not that overgrownl blonde irooster of yours.",0
"Fails as a reader and as an editor. As a reader, the home page only recommends premium articles which I can't read without paying, which makes me think the product manager who proposed it was either evil or dim. As an editor, it frequently inserts non- breaking spaces, so the lines break at weird places, unless I go back and individually replace them, if I even can. I gave it 2 stars, since it doesn't install a virus or frame me for murder.",0
"Last update stopped you being able to mute authors and subjects you consider drivel. I subscribe for 3 authors and 1 subject and have no interest in politics, pandemics, the us election or any of the other noisy rubbish",0
Really not an easy app to navigate. I have yet to discover how to edit my comments. The only reason I installed the app was because I assumed it would make things like editing easier that over a phone browser. But nope. Meanwhile the installation did take notice of how many free articles I have left for the month.,0
I liked the app. But I am facing two issues. 1. How to sort on the basis of date and minutes to read . For example - within last month and 1 min read. Currently you have sorting on the basis of topic. 2. How to enlarge or change font size. Is it possible to change it within app. So reading ll become easier.,0
"make it more friendly for publication teams to submit draft and publish to publication. some of are writers mostly use their smartphone for writing story, and the mobile app dont have the publication feature.",0
"The content filter is pretty bad. I'm trying to see all contents related to ""cryptocurrency"" and filter it by ""latest"" and there's no such filter. Only the website has the feature (even if it works in a cumbersome manner). The app is pretty much useless.",0
"App and the platform is top-notch, except for the part that it has stopped saving articles. Its shows previously saved articles but not any of the new once. If this is not a bug then kindly guide me to solve this. I have a paid membership account.",0
"-3 stars for the number of taps required to read comments - it's utterly absurd that the developers haven't stacked the conversations and force us back and forward, back and forward.",0
Very dissapointing that you can't read anything without paying for subscription,0
I am unable to create ac since office 365 is detecting threat and won't let me create my account. What to do? I managed to create the ac but when I wanna log in I rcv a email verification which leads me to a page which is recognised as a virus threat by Microsoft 365. Why can't I log in by using password?,0
"I do not understand why I should pay for reading articles in your app while the same articles and same topics could be found on thousands of modern and well designed websites for free. I suggest to change your marketing strategy, I can see that to pay for reading articles gonna leads you soon to nowhere. Instead, how about to let articles for free but those free articles will serve as backlink to e-book selling platform. This is a solid marketing strategy. Regards.",0
2020-07-20: its practically impossible to get a free article. Only way now is to pay!! 2019-10: good articles. but recently they seem all premium and need to be paid for. would also like an option to not get advertised premium articles.,0
Make some more articles available for people who don't want to buy your premium subscription plan. The monthly limit ends just too quickly. I hope you shall have a look into this.,0
Really well curated but Nothing free here buy install only if you can afford the premium pack for a ridiculous sum of 3.5k a year Great content was free now pushed literally all of it under premium practically useless for free user and subscription is astronomically high ₹3500 per year.,0
"Only three articles per month unless you are a paying member. This limit is, well, too limiting.",0
I've been trying to create an account with e-mail. The system just keeps resending me confirmation mails and nothing is happening. I like the site though.,0
Paywall for user generated content? Seriously?,0
90% of recommendation is for paid membership,0
As of now it is the worst app i have ever used . After downloading there is problem with signing in. Later on not even a single image get uploaded to this app neither in your story nor on profile. Draft section never opens,0
"Story randomly blocked without explanation, and it doesn't even show anything on my end. I only found out because a friend I linked it to wasn't able to view.",0
I like but can't afford to pay subscription great stories but the only ones they send me of my interest are paid so I can only read 2 and 4 year old articles if it was a reasonable price I would love.,0
Some interesting articles but absolutely nothing from outside the US. The search for a truly global aggregator goes on. Uninstalled.,0
"Freezing repeatedly on oneUI Samsung galaxy note 9 for past couple of days, practically unusable. Working fine on my ipad.",0
Nah I don't need more input in just another format...,0
"When I hit back and make my keyboard dissapear, I can't make the keyboard appear even afer I tap at anywhere on my screen. I also can't upload my photo. Having my draft dissapeared is completely sucks.",0
The app pushes you a lot of propaganda articles even in subscription mode.,0
I'm trying to login with your App but failed to login. But I'm able to use medium in browser with same account. Can you help me with this?,0
Quality of content is very close to Facebook clickbait articles. Asking to pay a monthly fee for clickbait is ridiculous. No thanks.,0
There is a lot of good content. But like everything else you have to pay to reach it.,0
Good articles but almost everything requires you to subscribe to read the entire article.,0
The UI needs a lot of improvement wrt to font formatting and more readymade templates.,0
Provides little control over specifying interests. This app is a clunky straitjacketed toy posing as something useful.,0
Literally every article i open is to be paid for.So annoying!!!,0
"While the app is overall well made, what really puts me off about it (and led me to uninstall it) is the strong pressure to buy a membership in order to read just about any of the articles. There is only a 3 article limit per month. Even if you reach the limit, Medium still sends notifications about stories which you can click on to hit a paywall. It is such a smack in the face for casual readers.",0
"Buggy. Limited to 3 premium articles, search function is poor, the 'recommended' algorithm needs a lot of work, seems a bit pushy and some of it would be better on twitter as a rant rather than dressed up as an article. However there are some great articles on here, but I can't read all of them without paying (or searching & sometimes finding them elsewhere for free). I installed as I wanted info but uninstalling because I can get better/same info elsewhere & not have a buggy app irritating me.",0
Super nice but I thought it was free. Well it's not,0
"Katie Couric article on Flossing lead to Medium App. I signed in with Google, read the rest of the article, added a few clap applause symbols to a few comment ""Responses"". But, was not allowed to add my Own ""Response""!! : wider dental TAPE hurts fingers and gums LESS than ""Floss"", either Waxed Flavored Mint or Unwaxed."" App is not special, so un- installing asap.",0
Really wish I could like this but the articles I get are never recent. It's like no one posts often or I follow the wrong things. Confusing to say the least.,0
"Yes, but but more expensive than Quora, which I have decided to stay with - only have the time for one. Medium could also use some tighter moderation, I have resented paying for articles with interesting titles that are either personal rants or warm, fuzzy & factless",0
The articles shown on the home page are mostly for the premium. And we cant read them without paying. For other content we have to search for the free content. Although the content was good but the restrictions irks me.,0
"Many good features, but DANG! One that's very important to me just does not work. I am a paid-up member, and yet when I bookmark a story on my PC, that story is NOT available offline when I try to access it via this app in situations where I am offline (but had been online earlier).  I double dare you to tell me why this feature does not work. Better yet, fix it! Broken in version 3.6.1000095",0
"Wanted to try it but the first page where we choose the topics itself is neither sorted nor grouped. So, I didn't want to waste my time such a poor designed app. Hope developers improve it.",0
Sometimes I open a link on Google and this poop app jumps in front of me count as I read one article. I think the price of the service is abusive and they pay almost nothing to writers. Dev.to and hacker.io are much better platforms in general.,0
"I was very enamored of the articles when I first joined Medium, and over time my feed was curated to the same ideas circulating over and over. It got to the point where I was only staying for one or two authors, which made the community no longer useful to me. If I start finding an interest in writing myself, I may return. As it is, the redundant content and the outrageously over-priced premium subscription are deal breakers for me.",0
"Biased, liberal leaning trash run website with no way to filter or downvote bad or poorly written articles.",0
"There are some things i love about medium but the fact that it keeps recommending me content ""based on my reading history"", but completely misses the mark on what I'm actually interested in, is very annoying. There should be an option to remove topics that medium ""thinks"" i am interested. Not only is the recommendation system inaccurate, people's tastes and interests change and we should be given an option to reflect that in the app.",0
Informative articles. Monthly subscription to too much for my budget.,0
"I truly love the content, I get to see materials and news I truly care about. But the limit per day killed it. I won't mind having ads play for about 30 seconds after every few news I click, but a hard limit on the number of news I read per day just isn't working for me. I will be looking for another news app other than this. Medium had my enjoyment for a while with a wide variety of topics I am able to receive. Thanks for the short enjoyment, I hope the hard limit can be changed.",0
"Medium has been amazing at giving me great articles to read and really help me learn some new skills, but I have a problem with the app that almost makes me want to uninstall it completely. When reading an article with coding blocks usually, I'll scroll to a position, let go, and then after a small delay (150-700ms) it jumps down almost a screens worth of text. When I scroll back up, it does it again... It's exhausting trying to read a whole article.",0
"I spent some time away from Medium to come back to a severely reduced article limit or pay $5/month? hmm thats an easy decision. The app design is easy to navigate. From what I know prior to the pay wall, the writing is pretty good (nevermind the 5 star ""authors"" that reviewed this app). However, its not $5/month writing by any means.",0
"Overall, this app is a very terrible mobile experience. I've used it on a bunch of new Samsung phones, and it is consistently terrible the way the scrolling works as you read thru an article, and the way that you lose your place if you click on another story from an email, sometimes with no way to get back. Finally, reading the comments to anything is absolutely cumbersome at best. Their website is fine, so I cannot understand why this mobile app is so awful!@#$%!!!!",0
"Inundated with premium articles, to the point where its hard to find anything else. Even accidentally tapping on an article takes away from your three free articles, or just trying to read the subheader just to find out you're not interested. Not to mention, the recommendations are poorly chosen, and I constantly find myself drowining in articles all by the same single person, just because I read one of their pieces once.",0
"This site used to be pretty good - most articles were free, and there were ""starred"" articles here and there and they were the creme of the crop , and i more than once considered subscribing to be able to read those articles. Not now. i just scrolled through the homepage of the app - out of dozens of articles in my recommends, only one isn't starred. this kind of behavior doesn't make me want to pay $5/mo for this service. it makes me want to find another site.",0
This application and business model is silly. I get punished for trying to use the application by getting to read a maximum of five articles a month. The quality of the articles can be whatever it still counts towards the limit. Yet there's a nice little workaround when you go to incognito mode and bypass any limits. It's ironic that the application itself is pushing me away from it. My 2 cents: have premium articles that count towards the limit and the rest is free.,0
"Very annoying when scrolling upwards in an article. The ""back"", share, clap and bookmark buttons keep showing up. This makes it impossible to concentrate on the article. I usually have to go up & down because I read programming related articles and I move up to re-read pieces of code. Also, the ""code"" text in the articles is terribly unresponsive when I try to scroll right or left. Very very annoying application, completely ruined the articles for me. So stressed right now...",0
App eats up way too much space on my phone. It's also not very responsive or user friendly.,0
"It's a good app, I'd really be enjoying it. The only things I dislike about it is that I have to pay just for one or two posts that interested me. I'm not paying $5 just to read a couple of posts, let me watch an ad or something. The other thing is that you can't make posts to a publication from mobile. I have to go to browser and tap ""view as desktop""",0
"Absolutely love the platform! The variety topics and writers is very fun to browse through. A pity that I can only read through 3 articles per MONTH without paying.. Increase that limit, and you'll increase the rating folks! As an aside, I do plan to start writing articles. If my monthly share of payment through the writer programs covers the cost of a monthly payment to read more, I shall in that case also edit this to a full 5 stars. So in reality the cost factor is the ONLY negative!",0
"You are given only 5 free reads in a month. You cannot choose which 5 free articles you would like to read. For example if you tap on a headline and see the excerpt after it and decide you don't want to read it, the app still counts it as used a free read in the month. It would be nice to be able to view the excerpt (say 200 words) and then have a prompt asking if we would like to use our free reads to see full article without it using up our free read. Otherwise the app is good.",0
"Surprisingly bad. First time I tried to use it by using the ""Open in App"" button on an article in my browser, I entered a never ending loop between the app and my browser. After that, I hit my monthly limit, but there was no link presented for me to upgrade, which I was very willing to do. Growth PM dropped the ball here!",0
They give you very few free articles to decide if the paid subscription is worth it. Just now I downloaded it and now I have to wait a month to read another article.,0
"Love the articles, don't love the app. Once you open an article (including accidentally) you can't get rid of it from your reading history. Then you get hit with 'Recommendations based on your reading history' which you don't want. My widget is now half full of articles I don't want my kids seeing. I'll be reading on the PC from now on (unfortunately).",0
"I loved the app and used it every day, but today I decided to uninstall it and use apps like quora or reddit. The reason is that they increasingly showed me only articles for the premium subscription, I get that's how they monetize the app, but roughly 85% of the content the app showed me was only available through the premium tier, and it became frustrating. I hope they find a way soon to monetize without being so pushy.",0
"A cool blog for rich people. I like the layout, I like the concept, I read some interesting stories. But it's a joke 3 free readings a month. Everything now needs/wants a subscription. One needs to be selective and at the moment Medium doesn't win the cost:benefit ratio for me. I will continue to look, find and read independent blogs instead.",0
"Great content, but the search option in the app lacks basic features like sort based on date and sort based on min read. It would be great if these features are added.",0
I really used to like Medium. It was the first proper platform to unify blog creation. Unfortunately after it introduced the cap for reading I see totally no value in signing in the service. In this case I see the benefit of using ads on the page and targeting them to the appropriate audience. Would be much better business model then the one forcing people to pay after they reach the cap. I can see more and more people using the incognito mode in their browsers in order to bypass the paywall.,0
Very limited access for free users. You get one or two free articles per day and if you want to read more you need to subscribe. I don't use it that much to justify subscription but occasionally I find few interesting articles that i cannot actually read. Maybe having version with ads for non-payers will help generate some revenue. The app itself like the website is good and easy to use.,0
"Why do I need this app? I'm just a reader. On the app is more confortable, I get the desired articles on the home screen, one click less then the browser. But if I want to read the article I need to update my account and pay 10$/month, on the browser without account the same article is free. So why do I need to install this app? to get notifications, to use my mobile data and use phone resources, not being able to read the article.",0
"App unusable unless you pay. I'd be happy to use the app to read articles. But unless you pay for $5/month for member articles the app won't let you read *anything*. Neither will it tell you which are member articles so you can avoid them. So it is basically worse than nagware. So frustrating to use. Update: Installed again, member articles have stars, but no way to hide or filter them. The recommendations always favor member articles. Still unusable without a filter for pay-to-view articles.",0
"Everything is now paywall, good luck reading any content. Mostly drivel written by serial bloggers telling everyone to feel better. There used to be some incredible content, but it's not recommended for you in the feed because it's full of 6 min reads from authors that put out non-sens. I love the platform and the app, but now I literally read nothing. 5/month to see unprofessional blog posts isn't worth it.",0
"installed the app, selected my preferences. couldnt find my preference in the home screen and so I started clicking around for a bit. (yes i also clicked on a few articles) until I figured out how to (a second time!) set up my preferences. This time it took. At last found the stuff i was interested in ... to see upon clicking each and every entry it was paywalled. At that moment my enthusiasm evaporated. I'm uninstalling.",0
Some good content but most of it is behind a paywall. Constant emails for upgrading. I got it for tech articles. I read an article about women in tech and I got an email pigeon holing me into the Equality category which includes posts about sexual assault and oppression. It seems like Medium's content customizing algorithms need work. Women have other interests other than reading about the oppression they face. Unnecessarily depressing targeted posts. I get enough of that on Facebook.,0
I expected less clickbaity articles. sadly this seems to have become the new norm in online publishing.,0
"Can't read much without paying for it. And often what you are paying for is someone pumping their own product or service - for example, a comparison of trading bots where you find the one that wins is run by the guy that wrote the article, even though he never mentioned it. If you like paying for deceptive and opaque advertising methods, Medium is the best for that. Just imagine paying money to read something that is a sneaky advertisement. Does that make you happy? Then you need this.",0
"Usually whenever I find an interesting article, I add it to my reading list so I can read it later, the problem is that if I want to delete an article from my reading list I need to archived it first, then delete it, which is terrible UX. And even worse alot of times I remove and article from the list just to comeback later and find it still there, so the removal is not successful.",0
"Too many great articles are hidden behind a pay wall. I was allways of the opinion that high quality knowledge (which this app is filled with by the way) should be, if not free, than more affordable and availible. If the free content could be increased a bit, that would be great.",0
"Frustrating, difficult to use, crashes, poor help section. I tried to add tags to a post I have made still can't figure out how to do it. It says some icon will show up in the upper right hand corner but it doesn't. Medium sounds good in theory but in practice it's a big pain in the ass.",0
When you think about app monatization and apps itself you will realized that the world is going into a not sane and health way. The app only offers me restricted articles. And tell me that I have read a lot! And propose to pay for allowing me reading!?!?!? And that has a soft connection between author and app in the sense that the app doesn't give a considerable support for writer to create a proftiable paper. How such things works out in a massive way? Statistics explaina this.,0
"There are two facets to this rating. The app, the content is absolutely amazing, anyone who is willing to spend 5 dollars a month to read will find this app a delight like no other. Wonderful content indeed. However as a student who just cant afford to hand out that money, i feel robbed. I am more than willing to watch ads, however they simply won't let me read beyond the the first 5 lines... it's just sad.",0
Limits to how many articles you can read then requires an upgrade. What a joke! Go on their website and read as many as you want for free.,0
"I didn't pay too much attention at first about the subscription payment because I was too enchanted to read. It happens at the end of limit free trial... I loved Medium but the price is just too much that I can afford. As I no longer can read anything here, so why should I keep it? Thanks for the free reads anyway....",0
"I thought medium was cool when seeing it pop up as linked content on sites, so I finally jumped in and downloaded it. Only to crash into a pay wall. I'm good, I'm nicked and dimed enough by every other app out there that this sub isn't that important with most of their articles avaiable as link thru from other sites.",0
Used to really like it but now they've lost their way. Feed overpopulated with content you read occasionally overriding specified interests. Obsessively promote paid content most of which I find mediocre and will never me get to upgrade. Most annoying -- simply don't respond to users. Tried twice - Crickets!,0
"Third-party contents loading (tweets, github) within the app ""snap"" (auto scroll) the current view, very annoying and killed the reading experience. Contents suggestion is too tailored towards ""trendy"" articles instead of new/interesting ones (e. g. I actively opened some articles around new topics like FP/Scala/Haskell, instead Medium decides to suggest me another one among 1000th existing articles on why some random person likes or dislikes React Hooks / I don't really care?)",0
"I get dinged for articles I've never read. I have no idea how they determine you've read an article but I try to avoid even searching the titles out of fear they'll say I read something when I haven't. Often all I've done is scroll down thru the list to SEE if I find anything interesting. If I do, I'll read ONE. If not I ignore them all. Suddenly I can't read anything. There must be a better way of tracking.",0
"I use a Pixel 3XL. Scrolling articles is always a problem. The screen jumps around as if there are multiple inputs. I have tried reinstalling the app and different display settings. Let me know, I would be more than happy to try out alpha/beta releases aiming at fixing this problem.",0
This is a great platform but I can't find any post without star in my home page anymore. May be $50 annual payment isn't a big deal in USA or EU but it is in Turkey. Please do some discount or adjust the price for Turkey and other countries like that.,0
"I love articles on Medium specially the daily articles it suggests me. But, around the middle of February I hit my monthly article limit as a free subscriber. Ok, I get it. But it's March now and I can't still any articles! How would I know how much articles I can read for free in a month and when do Medium's months end? This is super frustrating!",0
"i love the Medium site and often start my morning with an article. But $5/month is pretty steep just to use the app interface where the content is already more narrow anyway due to some kind of ""suggestion"" algorithm. I will unfortunately be uninstalling the app and return to reading the content for free on my browser.",0
"I was interested in your site,but their were quite a few spelling errors in what I read. It week's to me that maybe author's could use spell check or something, as it took away from overall content for me. But I am reader and then I felt a bit scammed when I went back and your paywall came up. 5.00 isn't alot but it did kinda made me feel not so good, you should be upfront. Really I guess your idea is to suck people in then bring up the wall. I don't know about other's but it felt sneaky to me.",0
Amazing app! I loved the UI! The people in this huge community have a lot of knowledge to share! But here's one thing! Most of the articles are for Premium Members only that means you have to pay to read! That's dumb! Knowledge is to be shared for free!,0
The content on Medium is the reason to subscribe. The notifications seem useful and not too many. Note that when you upgrade to a paid subscription there's a bit of a lag time between payment and when you can start reading.,0
The app does not persists position when reading (which is huge bummer for device with low memory) and does not support save for offline reading. There's no point in using this app; web version and good ol' browser is actually much better than this.,0
"this app is good...... if you are a premium user. even this app is not mobile friendly. disappointed with the interface and their terms to force people applied premium. in addition, this app could be the best place to share idea. hope the developer will do the improvement soon.",0
"The app is great. But 14 out of 15 stories require a subscription to read: not so great. Plus there's no filter to see just the 'free' stories, so not worth using it without a subscription.",0
"Annoying with the premium subscription, just click into one article and that's it, they ""charges"" you ... For an app that presents a lot of technology you should be more accurate when someone is just reading the intro or all article. Thanks",0
IMHO i don't know why people make apps they are anoying and take up more space on the sdcard. I rather use the browser. If i unistall it it bugs me there apps better even though it can not find a way to search though it or open up annother tab in my browser. What the point? It does not even go back to or offer a least of what was previouly read even.,0
The star/paid/membership post were irritating more than ads coming up in other app.In people like me in developing country will never pay for content.So this app not get much revenue.So have options to filter out membership post or show some ads if that post needs to be seen.,0
There's a lot of problems in the android app . I can't even write an article using the android app,0
"Horribly dysfunctional UI and UX, especially what the latest updates brought out. Unable to edit posts immediately after publishing from the article page. Editing of video embeds on mobile isn't supported at all. Paywalled content populates the recommendations almost exclusively. Awful experience overall.",0
"If you have a long article, you have no idea where you are in the article, because the software architects, planners and designers totally had a shirt vison eyesight and totally forgot that a scroll bar or any visual indicator of the like would be a great benefit.",0
"I'm having trouble with the app - keep log out by itself, when reading the article. I don't know what's going on. Anyways, I love your aticles so much. Please help fix this problem so that I can read it happily.",0
"(+) This is original app from Medium. (-) Scolling inside article is suck. No toggle to on/off 'auto hide navigation bar' when reading. In bunny ear mode, title bar shows half itself. Distracted from reading due to bar keeps being hide/unhide.",0
"A bunch of great articles that can't be read unless you dish out some cash. I can understand sending me one or two articles that are premium, but all of them? Unnecessary and annoying. It doesn't make me want to sign up. It makes me want to uninstall.",0
"Was great til they started charging. Since then the content has became the same mediocre clickbait rubbish that is everywhere. Medium did have a unique democratic platform for think pieces, independent journalism and stimulating discussion - now it's just another irrelevant platform full of self-improvement listicles and self-indulgent pseudo-journalism.",0
"First I can read articles, and then I can't and have to sign up...again??? I downloaded app and keep getting notifications to read articles. After having gone through a sign-up process I'm being asked again to create an account. Very annoying. Deleting app today..",0
"App flow and content is good, but i don't understand why the developers doesn't included History of articles, what we read. And it is very very difficult to findout the article, which we read earlier.",0
"very very limited reading, even when giving email address for "" membership"". i thought once registered, you could read star marked content that did not go towards miserly monthly limits. that is not the case. uninstalled.",0
"This app is useless if i cant keep track of stories i read. A lot of times i need to go back to stories that i had read few days back for reference, but i cant do that here. So better to use chrome browser where i can access history and also bookmark imp",0
"Downloaded for the articles I read online for free, thinking this app might be useful. Then I get a pop-up. ""Subscribe for more."" Although the articles can be useful, the answer is... Um no thank you.",0
"1. It lets you to read few stories before starting to ask your money. 2. Even if you carefully picked topics you are interested in, it pushes ""editor's choice"" at you. Mostly politics.",0
Really really good contents. But now it's not free anymore.,0
"Basically just half the already stripped down mobile website. Fine if you're a reader, beyond useless if you're a writer trying to manage your stories and publications on the go. Honestly a bit baffling that it lacks so much of the site's relatively simple functionality.",0
Liked the app but why it has to run in the background even after I have disabled all notifications. I want to read the articles on demand and do not want this app to always run in the background.,0
"The Medium site needs to be entered using a link sent by email. If I use a browser it works. Opening with this just sends me back to the ""we have sent you a link by email..."" page. An endless loop.",0
Plz fix this app . When I update my answer in pc and change something this app doesn't update it . Plz fix the bugs. Also my humble request is to lower your price . 5$ per month is a lot and sounds cheating since other platform offers free of cost reading.give some kind of permanent subscription pack,0
"It's very nice. But there are still many bug fixes to be made like when I try to save a post offline, it tells me I should connect and it cannot change my profile photo.",0
"Highly informative. Been using it since they launched. But nowadays, any article you see is member exclusive. Medium is totally away from it's business model that it used to promise years ago. Shame on you!",0
"awesome. nice and simple interface. it do what it should do perfectly. edit: unfortunately i need to lower down my rating because although it was fine on my phone, it keeps force closing on my tablet so that i cant even read a single paragraph",0
Once it is pay only it will be bye-bye Medium. There have been some interesting articles. However not enough to justify 50$ a year as most of the content is not for me...,0
"The articles are great but the app couldn't possibly be worse. It's horrible to read comments and their responses, you can't archive an article that's not on your reading list, you can't save them into different lists etc",0
"95% OF ARTICLES ARE NOW PREMIUM... Used to be able to read many, free, articles about things I care about, with a reasonable amount of premium ones too. Now almost everything is premium. I'm finding myself using the platform less and less.",0
"Articles look interesting however, the Medium app seems to alter google search results and google app recommendations. This is particularly frustrating because I am blocked from reading most articles since I am not a paying member.",0
Too buggy. I often need to use the desktop version instead. Also. Make the Partner Program available in India.,0
"Back button behaviour is very annoying even after a week of constant usage. When i deeplink from gmail and finish reading the article, back should bring me to gmail, not to home of the medium app. Please stick to android guidelines and make UP button different from the BACK.",0
"I installed this because my governor's address about covid19 required it. I thought, maybe here's a news app I can really use, maybe this one is different. No. It's full of the same clickbait nonsense and pop culture pseudoscience drivel that has infected the rest of the internet, only you have to pay for the privilege of a catered experience. Absolutely bonkers. I signed up for topics that interested me, not influencers' motivational articles recommended because of viewer count.",0
"No, medium. I don't ""read a lot"" in your app. As a matter of fact, today was the first time I opened it in over a month. With the very first article - ""you read a lot. Upgrade!"". That won't make me like you to say the least.",0
"when reading examples of code it wraps the text making it really hard to see indentation, this makes it extremely difficult to read. I thought the app might handle this better than the website but it makes it worse with the larger font",0
"I like the idea but I am not known publisher and I want people to read me, but if that means they 'll pay, it would limit mysefl just to the current users in medium also I find hard to understand how the interaction work between members and non members",0
"Writing fuctions are very limited compared to laptop, but reading experience is good. Many features are missing compared to writing a story on a laptop e.g. zero image editing fuctions and formatting functions like enlargeing the first alphabet of a paragraph.",0
Lots of bugs. There is no longer any way to archive articles. The help bot doesn't open the keyboard drawer to allow the user to type a question.,0
"recently the app stopped working. As i open it, the screen starts to flicker. I reinstalled, it helped for a while, and now again screen flickering. ANNOYING!!",0
"You have to upgrade to premium membership for most of the articles.. Not really recommending it, if you are looking for a good free reading app for yourself..",0
Uninstalling as I'm fed up with the spam email with links to articles that I would have to pay to read. Fair enough restrict how many articles you can read without a sub but the email spam is what's put me off.,0
Since today there seems to be a bug with the app. Whenever I open a story it crashes the app. Even after reinstalling the app I get the same error. The app is now unusable for me 😭,0
"""Ready for the next chapter? upgrade"" no thank you, uninstallation seems like a better option. I would prefer reading on the website itself.",0
"I faced one trouble, when I don't know meaning of any word then i have to copy it and then search it on google. it will be better when reader do not have to go to Crome or Google seprately and get the direct excess to google the word",0
"Great idea, but don't like the fact that only a certain amount of stories are available unless you subscribe to the paid version. There are so many free subscriptions that I uninstalled the app.",0
"I have selected Softwate Development as an interest, read a few articles, now the app only shows me javascript articles, even though I removed Software Development and any IT related interest from my preferences (it bases the elarticles to be shown in the articles you've read, not in the preferences). The end result is that the app became useless",0
Pretty good for reading but turns out they want a monthly fee for letting you read other people's content. So I'm back to the free internet and Pocket app again.,0
"May be interesting for young people that don't already have most of their problems solved. For those of us that are older and have already figured life out along with the problems that come with it, the topics are boring. Pixel 2 XL",0
"Every time I open an article, it turns out to be for subscribed members only and it says that I have to upgrade. How do I find free articles to read that doesn't require subscription?",0
"I was used to highlight some text with my last Galaxy S7, but the app does not give that option anymore with my brand new Xiaomi Mi9. In my opinion, it is very useful. Could you please fix it ?",0
As a reader of medium over the years I have steadily witnessed a decline in quality of content with an increase of content hidden behind paywalls. Not a good combo.,0
"medium application is bad experience for searching any content, i search in chrome so i found my problem in medium, but same problem searching in app and click on link it's nothing response :(",0
"I typically write using other applications and copy-paste to Medium, and all my formatting is lost in the process, necessitating a tedious search of my original document and manually applying the formatting in Medium.",0
"After taking update before 2 days, it is not working. It takes lot of time to load and not load many times. Issues with Bookmarks screen as well.",0
"Not enough information provided about the sources, authority, experience or qualifications of your authors so unable to judge the truth or otherwise of the information in your articles. Needs more referencing to make it a valid source of reliable information. Interesting? - yes. Informative? - not sure.",0
Unable to use a screen reader and could only read 2-3 lines before story was over. However I like the idea of the stories. Thank you Merry Christmas.,0
"Only lets you open one article at a time - if you were in the middle of reading something then accidentally open another medium link, you're screwed.",0
"Very nice app, interesting article but the offline mode doesn't work on my Galaxy S9. My reading list is not available when I have no Internet connection",0
"One of the greatest reading apps, really. But when a blocking pop-up came up and asking me to pay, it really disappointed me. Does it really have to be this way?",0
Love the app and articles so much. Was sad to find out it's a subscription.,0
Why would I pay something free in web browser,0
"It's very costly, I think it should be free to everyone",0
Was a great source of reading until recently. About 90% of the articles are member-only. So basically you can't read anything unless you pay.,0
"Any time I load a medium story from Google News, the app just shows me a blank white screen. For me, Medium is more usable without this app installed.",0
I used to use medium all the time. But for about 6 months 9 out of 10 stories in my feed are behind the paywall. I guess I'll stick to Flipboard.,0
Galaxy S10. The app doesn't allow to sigh in via email. After opening the link via the app it throws an error and takes me back to the sign im screen. Unusable on my phone.,0
I never encountered a reading limit before signing up for a membership. Now I'm expected to pay. I would not consider the content worth the price.,0
"Good user-written content, but the membership costs too much. This kind of app should be free with ads, not paid.",0
"I downloaded the app in order to access one recipe. 3 free ""articles""/month and $5/month to subscribe. For stories seem to be little more than well-written musings? No thanks.",0
"The new business model with article cap is terrible, plus it only suggest premium article on the main page. It feels like github turning into AWS. Some good targeted ads would make more sense, and paying to remove them.",0
The mobile app is very hard to use. Sharing a link is not intuitive. Enabling network detection for calling in with a call vs. over wifi doesn't work.,0
This app is not allowing me to publish my story at all it keeps saying 'you reached the limit of your publishing...' What is wrong with this app. And I'm new to this app,0
Does not show my bookmarks which were created in the web browser. Thus much less useful than using a web browser.,0
"If i sign in, I'm able to read only a few articles in a month. But if i don't sign in and don't use the app, I'm able to read so many articles for free. Then why sign in?",0
"Somewhat useful. The app keeps ""wandering"" in article suggestions. I'd say stick to whatever the user has selected as interests.",0
"It's a great app, till you stop being able to use it without paying. And their website will keep nagging you to use the app.",0
I loved this for the 1st 5 minutes until I couldn't continue reading and learning without paying for it. I'll go back to googling everything and reading free facebook articles. thanks lol,0
Bug: removing an item from the reading list doesn't always work. Some articles stubbornly remain upon a reopening of the app.,0
Every article appears in reading suggestion requires membership. Its very unfair free article lomit per month is 5. Company should review its limitation for users with some ads access like youtube. Thanks.,0
No point in having a free version of the app if 90% of the articles it serves you are subscriber-only.,0
"It's weird how you get rewarded for not being logged in. Without paying, you can only read a couple of articles per month, but if you are anonymous you can read how many articles you want.",0
"It was good on the first years, but now it became a non free app, almost every article is not accessible for free",0
"You can only get through a few articles before you start hitting paywalls. The content is not worth more than a few ad views to me, and ceartinly not $50/yr.",0
Pretty shocked at how few articles I was allowed before hitting the pay wall. They seemed pretty amateurish. Probably some gems in there but I didn't find them. I'd rather donate more to wikipedia instead.,0
The free offering is just a ridiculously narrow. I had a better experience on my laptop with no registered account than with the app and a free account.,0
"The app is good, but this app force us to pay. 3 articles per month for free users? Come on, even a toddler read more than that.",0
Good but it isn't free. For free you get to read just about 3 articles per month and then there's paid subscription. Uninstalling..,0
"Extremely limited free reading content, which cripples the app and prevents viewing further articles. Enjoy the trial while it lasts. I do not see the value in subscribing at this time.",0
Only few articles for free account. Interesting articles. Amount of articles can be increased.,0
More than 95% are premium only!! I had premium for a while and now that I don't I have to scroll past 30 articles a time to find one I can read,0
"The concept is great, however having set my interests twice my home page is not showing them. What's the point. I don't have time to scroll through loads of stuff I'm not interested in.",0
Reading cap for the free user is maybe 1 article per week or less. For this we get spam email and spam notifications almost daily.,0
"The mobile app is plain and simple, all good. But now it's all about premium content. This is probably a premium only app now.",0
So much low quality content is published and too many things require a subscription. The content is badly tuned to me.,0
It is nice app for readers,0
"About 3 weeks ago the app started to continiously fail to open links (empty ""home"" activity), that makes it pretty much useless.",0
i used to love reading medium posts but after they introduced premium subscription i cant find any good free content. 50 dollars a year is super expensive,0
9 analytics & trackers present in the app! More access restrictions!!,0
"As a reader, it is very limiting to be unable to open links from one article. Pressing on a link brings me back to the home.",0
"Good content, but the 'select number of artcles per month' you can read before upgrading to $5 per month is very small.",0
"some OK content, but after only a few articles they want a huge monthly fee. not worth it - the info is allavailable for free.",0
I just downloaded the like an hour ago and read 4 article and the next comes a message that my free membership for a month has expired ☹️,0
"Basically every content there you need to upgrade (pay) to get, especially all of the eecommended articles. Then, all of the articles I see in my feed are leftists saying how men are terrible. I want to read insights, facts, not someone ranting about how he/she is feeling. When I say this, I'm not being a butthurt person, but I thought the content would be more neutral and focus on data, not on opinions. The app works well and is beautiful though.",0
the app is good but you need to upgrade a lot. Which is expensive I think they should let the books be free.,0
"Installed app after reading an interesting article on programming. I added interests like programming, javascript etc, then go to homepage, first recommendation: ""what men want more than sex""... yeah, the app isnt for me.",0
"the app seems nice, but it asks for your topics preferences at the start. then it shows whatever it wants but anything even remotely related to the topics I selected",0
"Great idea, well executed, just too expensive to get behind the paywall.",0
"Nothing special, all articles that you can read for free on the web actually require subscription on this app just because. Highly not recommended.",0
"An app for a reading platform that doesn't allow you to read. Ironically, the best reading experience ends up being a browser incognito window.",0
I'm not sure when the membership fee happened; I've been away for a yr(+). I like the fact that authors get paid but I didn't get paid for my story. And I don't know if there's a fee to write & post stories?? Gonna check out the web for details. A notice would have been nice Medium.,0
Rarely use it but hit free rate limit almost immediately. Either pay to become a premium member from the start or don't even bother.,0
"It used to be good, but now almost every article is premium content. Started to look for alternatives.",0
"registered, choose the topics im interested in.. and have a home feed full of ""recommended"" ""popular"" stories that aren't in my interest lists, this is not what I hoped to get and utterly useless for me",0
"They say we can have 5 readings per day with the free membership, yet everyday i check the app it says i reached my quota for the day. So annoying.",0
"Would be for five stars, except that 'towards data science' articles do not handle in the app properly and end up redirecting to Firefox every single time which is frustrating.",0
there are some scrolling issues with the app. i feel the experience in a web browser is better.,0
"Articles are good.But app has very limited number of free reads,after that you need to get a premium membership.",0
It's a useful app if you're curious. And I'd happily use it but the app is expensive so I had to uninstall..,0
Great source of meaningful information... It's not free and only allows you to read 2 or 3 articles before you've reached your limit. Information shouldn't be monetized,0
Doesn't provide basic features as keep an article open in the background and bookmarks to specific positions within an article. Useless app.,0
Can't read a lot of articles... I just read one and I was assisted with a popup staying I have reached the limit on the number of articles for a day,0
I'm super annoyed at the way it can only be read one tab at a time. Would rather just read Medium posts in a mobile browser,0
Decent app. The limit on free articles is too low and price point annoys me to the point that I'm not purchasing it out of spite.,0
"Mixed bag Some good articles can be read for free, after that they ask you for subscription which is overpriced. Nothing exclusive.",0
"the featured recomendstions are always ""premium"" when they show in your homescreenn even if the article itself is free when searched for manually",0
"Everywhere with the same ""upgrade to xxx"", to read more than 10 lines, to listen to it, to this or that. Fake free app.",0
Great app ... Not willing to pay $5 a month to use it though,0
Nice content but sadly you can only see a limited amount until yoh have to upgrade to a premium membership which is quite expensive,0
"The app is good but it cripples you from reading more articles, so you are better off reading on a browser.",0
"Tried to be sneaky and only get me to rate the app if I said I liked it. The aggressive growth tactics that have made their way into medium have utterly killed the product for me. Once elegant, it's now a lumbering mess in search of a viable business model. Shame.",0
"If you want to read more than 3 articles,you have to pay each month, Quality is good, but I'm not going to pay for the contents,when you can read/write blogs for free.",0
Articles frequently not cached for offline viewing and those that are are missing images and code samples as they're embedded webpages. Not really good enough,0
Impossible to scroll down while reading articles. The app insists on bringing me back to the top of the article everytime I scroll down,0
I subscribed thinking I could get articles in audio due to severe headaches restriction my eyes Cant seem to enable that feature.,0
"who uses paid app in this era, please earn from ads or find some other way. I just uninstalled the app after seeing tha ""please upgrade to read more"" page",0
"I am unable to upgrade the app. Whatever bank options I am putting it's showing unavailable, tough I am able to do all kinds of transactions from that account",0
"Virtually every article requires subscription. That would be OK if content was so good, but some articles were free if you google them",0
"Nice platform, accept one of my article received an error server",0
"After the latest update, it takes 1 minute or more to launch. Too slow.",0
"Most topics are Interesting, but can't read anything. App isn't useful to me.",0
Infuriating how I can't see a feed of only the publications I follow. I tried a subscription but I'm giving up now.,0
"Good articles, or at least good titles because with this expensive subscription scheme there's nothing to read anymore",0
"Sadly, uninstalled. The clap button is distracting when reading and there is no option to hide it.",0
Has some good articles but as of late it has a lot of anti-white people things. I check often and that's usually all I see.,0
Was a great app /service now all notifications lead me to blocked pay wall screens. if you're willing to pay the subscription it's ok.,0
"good app, but requires a fee if you wish to access and read the articles posted onsite.",0
The app is slow for such good contents. Loads slow and also the Search features can be optimized too,0
I can sign in to Medium with my laptop. But I can't sign in with this app in my phone.,0
Prompted me to upgrade to premium as soon as I installed it. Blocked me from seeing any articles.,0
"while i understand original articles should be behind paywall, asking users to pay for articles which are actually free by original publisher is misleading.",0
"This app kind of limits a user very few articles, per month, till one uses the premium subscription. Doesn't meet my expectation.",0
I can't remove/block notification 'listen to stories' which I didn't use and want to. Had to delete the app to remove it.,0
Fails to open from Google feed. Seems to open but just remains blank and flashes alot.,0
"it s sad that some lf us can't upgrade the app and keep reading, i'll just have to uninstall it, it was good while it lasted.",0
"Notifications about new articles lead to ""oh no, your free articles limit has expired""",0
Cant zoom in articles. Often useless notifiations which doesn't open what they notify about.,0
"can't get to work properly, anything i ""follow"" doesnt actually appear in my followed list, so all im getting articles on are crypto and blockchain",0
I would prefer seeing ads than being limited as a free member. It disappointed me before attracting me.,0
"Paywall is annoying, especially because the article quality is going down.",0
I loaded the app and picked a few topics. Almost all of the topics had nothing to do with my interests. Changing the interest did nothing. It is a waste of time for people who want real news and information.,0
this app has gone downhill. Notifications about articles that are behind a paywall in the app but open on the web. Uninstalling.,0
All the claps and people I follow from medium mobile app are not working.The next time I am unable to see my previous claps or people I followed remain unfollowed.,0
The app is fine but what's with not being able to read even one article in full because I'm not in Membership,0
Feels like Medium is stuck in the last decade and doesn't care about privacy of its users at all.,0
"A bit confusing and inelegant. Missing certain features, like the ability to comment?",0
Please add the Series editor for Android devices. I don't understand why android can't have it,0
"Everything was going good, until they decided to charge the app users. Tell me one thing guys, why would anyone pay and use the app, if they can open it up in their mobile browsers and use it for free?",0
"I used it for one day, then you have to pay. The price is high for Argentina so I'll keep using other free apps. Bye Medium",0
Reading list is extremely buggy - items reappear on the list after being removed multiple times -,0
Was looking forward to having a new source of interesting articles to read but I only ever get premium content pushed to me. How can I judge if the site is worth paying for if I never get to read anything?,0
Reading list on the app has some delays to reflect the latest status.,0
Somehow this app keeps sending me notifications advertising things to read despite me silencing their notifications multiple times. Uninstalling so I won't be nagged.,0
Nice idea but two free articles is not enough to convince me. Needs a better pricing model.,0
"Weird, I'm already signed in but it said ""can not save post because you are no longer signed in""",0
"Maybe I'm not subscribed to the right content, but the writing I'm seeing isn't worth $5/month",0
Stop milking cash from a blog. I get interesting daily digests but can't read them on the 3rd of the month unless I pay money. Uninstalling!,0
Most of articles can access only with premium subscription..,0
"Unable to change the font, bad reading experience...",0
Love it but I'm not able to immerse in a full screen mode while reading,0
The app keeps on flickering. Unable to open it.please fix it.,0
Uninstalling. ..Used to love this app but no I'm not going to pay a monthly fee just to read more things that are available free on the internet.. =/,0
Not for the weak of character. This app needs warnings and ratings. Full investigations on some articles recommended. Deleted,0
Just another silly so that gets you hooked then suckers you in with monthly fees.,0
now there are so many article require a Subscribtion to read. 🙁,0
The app is so limiting. I can't do anything with the publications I manage.,0
App keeps crashing,0
"Not sure why I would have to upgrade and pay when I can go on browser and read as many articles as I want? However, I can understand if you dont make money from adverts",0
"Good idea, but can't upgrade. Something went wrong on our side.",0
access for a professional curated content could've been available to free users.,0
really good content except it's not all free.... :(,0
"Useless if you don't pay, 2 stars for the good article i read out of 3",0
Good articles but Membership cost doesn't make sense as you can get free at other site,0
Too many bait and switch (pay to view) articles.,0
App is good but you should provide filter to apply to read free articles.,0
To read the articles we should upgrade the app by making payment of $5/Month. worst,0
Ever since you need to pay for read.. lost me as a user. I also wrote articles there and still need to pay,0
Beautiful stories but limited when you cannot upgrade,0
Good but I want More Engaging In local language,0
Had challenge in accessing article post upgrade & payment,0
Do not like the fact that they allow you to read only a couple of articles before the membership trouble begins.,0
Most content is premium. If i wanted to pay for content i would buy actual journalism not this.,0
Must install app to comment via mobile; app has no means of commenting on the article.,0
"I can't log in with (My email, my fb ,...)",0
My play store is connected with payrm upi but im not able to make payment using this upi as its showing unavailable for this purchase.,0
This might be a fantastic app but I won't find out. I don't want to have to sign up simpmy to read an article. :(,0
Not a good experience. Doesn't listen to what you want to read. UI isn't great. This is a mess.,0
Great but one article a day is ridiculous..,0
"App is good, but there is a paywall :(.",0
After a limited number of views the app requires you to become member to view more. Seems like a racket.,0
loved it until the subscription model kicked in.,0
opened twon or three articles after that i had to upgrade.... should just charge a fee for the app upfront and be honest,0
many articles need to be paid to read in full.,0
They want me to pay 5$ for me to pay monthly for the content which is crowd source. I understand i have to pay some fee for consuming their platform. I guess 5$ per month is too high. I pay 2$ for google music subscription. I think 2$ would be a good price for indian market.,0
It used to be an excellent app when it was free.,0
"Doesn't show latest stories on the home screen, and there is no way to customize it.",0
Reading articles is not free in Medium . Not a good app for Reader's.,0
Bookmarking from notification bar doesn't work.,0
App is getting closed frequently. MIUI 10.3.13,0
"I am only allowed to read 3 stories!!! and If I wanted more I need to upgrade the app, what a waste of space.",0
The app is no longer exciting since it introduced subscriptions,0
Alot of paid articles,0
Most good articles are now behind the pay wall,0
Total scam. Even if you write for them they set a short limit on what you can read before getting hit by a pay wall. Its like Uber except most of the drivers aren't gettinf paid and theyre supposed to pay Uber for the use of the car they drive. Dummmb,0
the app has great content but then it hangs,0
The app must be free of cost its chagers the amount for upgrade version that thinh is annoying.....😥😥,0
I think you're going too aggressively with your subscription model and premium content push... I'm removing it...,0
Always get recommendation for paid content,0
too many articles are behind the paywall,0
Everything was fine until you start asking for money.,0
A very low quality of pictures in the app :(,0
"You are sent to Medium through an interest link in Google. You are asked to log in. You do that and are redirected to the Medium homepage, with several stupid links and no sign of the one you actually had the intention to read. You give up.",0
loved it until the subscription model kicked in,0
It was promising until the charging model.,0
High subscription costs for 3rd world countries.,0
Free member can't access reading anymore,0
Claps no longer work since the last update.,0
"How to ""unfollow"" feminist's posts? I'm not sure when did I subscribed to tags related to that stuff. But it was unpleasant experiences, otherwise a great app with interesting contents.",0
Nice stories and articles but 50eur/y that is insane,0
Website is good but I am unable to install this app.,0
"While it's a high quality app, the very idea of endless consuming random people's ""wisdom"" is flawed and contradicts the informational diet. Having read just a few posts provokes my inferiority complex and the Fear of Missing Out. The verdict is - no thanks. I don't need another Facebook.",0
I feel that gonna work for me thank God bless us 😎😊,0
not a fan of how hard y'all are pushing for premium,0
"Uninstalled, such a greedy app and company. I can read blogs free on web, why do I need to pay membership here? Bad move.",0
"Cant edit posts at all, not on chrome either",0
App is good. The new business model is pretty annoying.,0
I hate how you just let someone get interested in the article then you cut off it is why im uninstalling the app.,0
The limits on not members are too strict..,0
Unless you pay for a membership....the app is useless,0
Good app great content but paid...,0
Always asking to upgrade. Couldnt read posts,0
Not a fan of having to sign up to test the app.,0
It's just a fine app to read articles.,0
Is the developer secretly ben 10? Coz the app is 10/10....okk I take it back...the dev is -10/10,0
This app is over priced.,0
Great until they wanted $5/ month,0
if you have the money its cool if you dont its not if you are not gonna pay dont download it cause you are barely getting anything,0
what is the purpose of having an android app if users can not read articles by seeing ads?,0
Too many paywall articles,0
great concept til I have to upgrade to read the stories. sorry,0
Prices are too high for such a student like me.,0
everything is good except charging for the app,0
Read a couple of articles and got an email saying I'd read my quota. Wanted money. Unsubscribed. Save yourself the trouble.,0
"Meh, pay wall too soon, can even look around",0
Thought we were global. Need to pay for my subscription using my beloved kenyan Mpesa. Now I cant enjoy my articles..,0
Sad that it requires subscription.,0
"Best curated knowledge app, period",0
You need purchase the app after 1 month to see content,0
2 stars cuz almost all articles have 🌟 now. -_-,0
Your auto refresh feature just erased my work in progress.,0
Good idea but very limited to what you can do for free.,0
Good luck finding a free article to read.,0
₹330 per month is very expensive for indian readers. It should be not more than ₹50.,0
Give me ads that I can ignore instead of making me pay.,0
Content isn't worth the high price.,0
"Great content, stupid subscription",0
difficult to use on my phone. cant find what I am looking for easily.,0
they let you read like 5 articles and then you have to pay,0
"Lack of easy comment mechanism leads to the majority of articles like 'I ate 500 big macs and grew to 18st, I was duped by McDonalds!'. Just full of narcissism.",0
stops working after 3 articles,0
The app doesn't give news according to interests,0
It sucks that medium only recommends articles that premium like damn you expect me to have money,0
Need full screen for bigger screens like note10 plus,0
it will be great if it doesn't ask for money,0
Just another top 10 list app,0
"New user,no experience",0
Can't become a member if i wish to. Invalid payment method it is showing,0
"I'm just bombarded with black lives matter rants, telling me that I need to ""purge myself of my white guilt"". I wanted articles, not propaganda!",0
I was satisfied,0
Should say yippy only get so many articles free per month,0
"the free plan is too ""short""",0
Please make it free,0
Most of the articles are paid,0
good app unless you read a lot,0
Did not really get time to evaluate this before the app insisted i subscribe.,0
"App is good, but costly in rupees",0
Very biased and anti Conservative,0
I'm not paying for freely published content.,0
Not my thing to read stories / information of others,0
Fix the problems or get off the grid.,0
Most enjoyable app on my phone,0
"At first I thought that medium would be an interesting news source. But boy have the recent articles that medium has for some reason decided to release and even recommend to me been absolute garbage. We have an uptight Karen who's mad that people are buying yeast, and a pair of brothers using moon logic to try to accuse Tara Reade of being Russian... Do you just let anybody write for this app or something? is there any sort of an editorial standard or do you just let any quack or shill in?",0
Last chance. Confirm my email or buh buh.,0
It used to be a free app.,0
No longer free.,0
"When reading isn't free, I feel bad.",0
"not sure of the value yet before I could decide (1 1/2 articles) I was already getting hit up to pay. Don't mind paying if I know the value is decent. Is the company afraid that I'll read up all the media in less than a month, will I? Longer trial or your losing business.",0
UK users pay more than US users,0
In can't read any articles b/c I haven't paid.,0
"The app says ""You read a lot"" but I did not.",0
Dont want to pay for news.,0
Seems to be lacking in multiple viewpoints. Most stores seem quite full of strong bias in one direction so I wonder on how the stories are aggregated. I want to see all side of an issue.,0
Sucks they want to charge for info,0
Not impressive less useful.. This app only for irrelevant world news,0
"Unfortunately with this ""educational"" material, money must change hands to have the opportunity to read it, when it's free elsewhere",0
plz dont download this app after some use it tells to upgrade the app nd get the app paid it is waste of time,0
Pricing not according to Indian standards!,0
I am 15 years old and live in South Africa. My parents are NOT able to pay!!! I will rather delete my account on Medium.,0
Asking money after reading 2 articles.. I dont like it.,0
To many writers who want to inject profanity and attack the beliefs of the reader. I don't need that.,0
"Sorry, Not worth of 5$/ month",0
"WTH, it's a app for reading articles!! Why would you make it paid.",0
"Paid In the world where knowledge is supposed to be free, they're charging for reading.",0
They boldly asked I pay to read articles. I was not expecting that.,0
"Even after choosing what i want to see, i was getting irrelevent results on top",0
I love medium –But I can't sign in! Help please!,0
A bunch of opinions from just regular people who think they are writers.,0
Art style in this app sucks,0
i like your abb.there is mutch to learn from other people from all over. thanks for top service.,0
It's an ocean of uninteresting amateur writers being suggest to you all day long.,0
I think it shity that it's so expensive to be a member not cool in the in the slightest,0
Few valuable thoughts in a pile of garbage and propaganda.,0
"Sadly must of the posts are marxist hypocrites, and even Blocking than doesn't keep their stickers from showing up in my lists.",0
Im not exactly sure what it does but im going to look into it,0
really all these contacts and such big words does not make a Big person were all created equall so be yourself and enjoy life,0
"""member previews"" thanks..",0
i m very new to this app.So never know.how does it works.Enable to comment on it right now .,0
Asks for money to let you read below-average articles.,0
Good expect u uave to pay after resding 4 articles. Not cool man so privey. Bs,0
your pricing strategy is not good. its soo high,0
Hey it's not free u have to pay for reading articles,0
Medium is expensive for a college student like me,0
Would love to see a free version of the app,0
why pay for medium while we can use quora for free.,0
App is ok. Content is trash,0
Did not find relevant content.,0
Rate to the app to grant me loan,0
You're monetizing information!,0
Not happy with this app,0
i haven't much money to use this 😔,0
everything is behind a pay wall,0
Should be free,0
Why do I have to pay to read?,0
99% on American topics?,0
You hit a reading limit...,0
You have to pay for it.,0
Only read one tiny thing,0
More than 5 star 🔥,0
Let me try it first,0
don't know,0
Not as well,0
it copies people's things,0
crashes on marshmallow,0
Trying it now,0
Not sure yet.,0
Our pass no money,0
Hmm not bad,0
Ok,0
Fair,0
Superb,0
演算機制太偏剖,0
They don't let you read an article without signing in. I am so tired of medium asking me to sign in and after signing in saying upgrade your plan.,0
Good,0
Buggy af,0
"Lately, the stories I get recommended directly in the app or through google feed are memebrship only. Haven't read something on it in weeks as only the first paragraph is available... Also... the membership requirement only appears if you are logged in...",0
"Once upon a time, this platform had abundant free articles I that I enjoyed to read daily. But now, 90% of all articles are premium and application doesn't even give 3 monthly limit to read with free account. That is so unfortunate that it is almost impossible to find something free in these days.",0
Absolutely worth it. No distraction from reading. You read or you write on medium. . Nothing else. So I wrote this review a couple of years ago. Now its all about money. Only 3 free articles per month is terrible. At least 10 should be given.,0
"Nice tech articles with elaborate explanation. Problem: Payment channel for Indian writers to receive money is not incorporated as of now. This is really a bad sign for Medium, because I believe there are so many good writers available from India.",0
Constantly getting hit by the pay wall when viewing free content. The whole system seems broken. Everyone I know is moving away from the platform. I used to be a big fan and used to enjoy this app.,0
There should be a daily limit instead of monthly limit.. otherwise stop sending daily read list if my monthly limit exceeded.,0
OK,0
So so,0
Limitations sucks,0
All recommended links lead to paywalled material. Medium is becoming a useless app.,0
Good,0
Good,0
"Educational, informative kind of like tedtalk but with text based platform",0
People don't understand how the nuance of how meduin works. A place were words matter.Yet people don't see the difference between a comment and a response. Came here to avoid the FB and Twitter trolls. Seems to be just as bad here. I lost faith in the app once major news branches started posting too meduim. I believe the trolls followed after.,0
"Without premium, I hardly see any article to read... Almost all of my wall are premium articles..",0
I am uninstalling.,0
re design booo,0
decent,0
The app only shows and promote premium artciles now on the app when you search for a topic,0
the UI is so outdated,0
good,0
nice book,0
I want this to be more like an rss feed where I can see the latest stuff I havent read from my favorite authors or topics. Instead there's no clear organization so I keep seeing the same stuff and I'm probably missing out on things I haven't read that are not easily visible.,0
Would rather medium curate important frontpage content than have an AI suggest click bait listicles and drown me in topics I'm not really interested in reading about on medium. App used to be better,0
"Medium as a portal is amazing but the app doesn't live up to the site. New updates have added nifty UI animations and layouts but app has become more data hungry than ever! Sometimes, it just sits for about 10+ seconds with network speed over 800KB/s when on WiFi. Pretty useless when on mobile internet, as the article thumbnail loads but clicking on an article takes forever to load. Edit: (March 2019) Open in app from web browser is broken since a long time now. Reducing a star till it's fixed.",0
"Nearly ALL (95%) of the content I get on my homepage is now premium content. I feel as if there's barely anything left to read after my three free articles of the month are up. What the heck happened, Medium? You used to be inviting and generous, now you just want us to pay for the majority of what you offer... :(",0
Can you guys support the notch to have the content move behind it as you scroll? This woukd make the app more immersive on S10 and Pixel 3.,0
Why the app stores too much data on phone storage? (Almost 5gb),0
"At first I was enthusiastic about what Medium was doing, but then I started seeing that the articles in my area of expertise were largely pandering and wildly inaccurate.  For non-fiction we need to support media outlets with the proper mechanisms and aspirations of journalism - even when it is not news and not political, accuracy matters and w/o those mechanisms the worst stuff will find its way to the top since it is not constrained by the need for accuracy.",0
"Ever since the update, the app appears as the android symbol. It used to be the green M logo before the update but since the update it is now the android symbol. Why the new update that didn't take? Apart from the buggy new update that took some time to fix, the app works okay",0
Paywalls abound.,0
Bad that they want money to read more articles :(,0
Searching doesn't provide all articles related to the words.,0
Reading history?,0
Awesome idea n great app design,0
"This app is a bookmark hell. Just bookmark one post, reopen the app and the same article, you'll see no bookmark. Tap on claps, no claps updated. In general if do something you can't be sure if that something happened. Just wondering do you have QA team?",0
I wrote something really awesome and published it but my story never appeared. Then I noticed I unfollowed and followed a few writers but my profile hasn't been updated. Bug??,0
"Some well written, insightful articles can be found on this platform. For the most part, however, it's populated with narcissistic, empty headed bloggers; the type who get published in Huff Post. The type who like to use photos of coffee cups standing on wooden tables next to a plate of artisan bagels to accompany their neoliberal drivel. And Medium wants to charge me to read this stuff.",0
"I know there are large amount of good quality essays on medium and that's why I use it, but, the recommendation algorithm is just TERRIBLE! I followed several different topics (interests), but after I finished reading a passage on bitcoin, now it's full of blockchain passages among which most are of poor quality! Now I have to manually enter each topic of my interest to read other essays.",0
"I LOVE this app, however the articlea aren't loading, and when I try to use the ""interests"" section I get ""failed to load message"". I tweeted a screen recording @thisismahmoud__. (I really want to give the app 5 stars but you have to fix this first :/)",0
Most stories are now members only. Not everyone can afford this.,0
"the only good thing about the app really is the ability to read some 
articles. but if you want to write anything, the text editor is not really 
complete and is kind of flaky. you can not even write nor download any 
articles for offline! oh and if you try to upgrade after the very short 
trial period, the app does not unlock until you reboot the app. it is 
overall kind of buggy and not that well suited for offline use- which is 
why i downloaded the app",0
It was great as long as it was free.,0
Not worth the membership,0
"The experience is absolutely terrible. There is a surprisingly high chance 
that an article simply won't load. Instead it just snaps back to the 
article list without an error message whatsoever even when having a stable 
connection. Reloading the app helps sometimes - not always - in which case 
I have to open the article in the browser instead, which works just fine. 
If you are offline or have a bad connection you are playing roulette when 
clicking on an article. Same issue there, albeit seemingly unrelated. 
Handling bad connections / offline is usually something where native apps 
outperform non-PWAs. Not in this case though. This of the rare cases where 
the native app XP is so bad that I prefer to use the browser version 
instead.",0
"When opening the app it returns to the home page instead of the article I 
was in the middle of reading.",0
Nowadays it's full of members-only content.,0
The audio play button not works :( :(,0
"This used to be my favorite source of unique content. And around Jan 2019, it went from a reasonable amount of content behind a paywall to what feels like over 80%. I am not a big enough reader to pay, and it is so easy to accidentally use one of your paltry 3 stories per month, that i am no longer getting any value out of the app or site. I had to unsubscribe from the really great digest emails that pulled me into a really great app regularly.And that meant i should uninstall the app, so i did.",0
I get only a black screen on my laptop which hides the story I want to read. I can read the story on my phone but can't make comments other than clapping.,0
"I have been a long time medium user. I use it for my purpose of learning 
what is new in dev tech stack and have learned so many things. But today I 
see that most of the stories are starred meaning I can only use it if I get 
a paid subscription, otherwise be happy with less than 20% of the articles 
in feed. If I see this as a regular trene for this month, I will regret but 
will delete medium app from my device. Never thought I would give this 
precioua app a negative rating for a reason like this that matters to 
readers.",0
"I'd like to use this app as intended, but no matter what interests I 
choose, the home screen only shows articles from just three categories: 
culture, technology and politics, plus an editor's pick or two. I can only 
access other categories through search. Also going on Notifications at 
Settings leads to my phone's app settings; to access the actual 
notification settings I must go to Email Settings. A fix for these flaws 
would be welcome.",0
"I can't even publish some of my works because of the app's insistent 
refusal saying that I provide unusual tags. I tried to add what the app 
calls 'usual' tags but still won't publish my works.",0
"I like the idea but the constant nagging to subscribe is wearing and the 
value of the articles is questionable. Plenty of free content out there 
just using google.",0
"I had this app a couple months ago but deleted it for personal reasons. I 
come back, and now I have to pay $5 a month to read more than half a dozen 
articles? Seriously?",0
"Where's the option to unfollow a topic? I click on the option but it 
doesn't quit my homeboard.",0
"Falla muchas veces al intentar abrir artículos. No los abre. Samsung S7,  SM-G930F. Android 8.0.0",0
Update works now,0
Unable to open any of the posts. Fix as soon as possible. Thanks.,0
"push notifications won't appear for 9 stories out of 10, home feed randomly 
stops loading - terrible experience overall",0
"bookmarks aren't synced across devices, I published an article through web 
interface and it's not available on mobile device when logged in with same 
account. needs lots of improvements.",0
Pages not opening after updates,0
"Writing an article is buggy. The selection popup has an improbable order 
that doesn't match the OS's default. Backspace a paragraph shuts the 
keyboard. Reading is ok.",0
What,0
"Unable to save the App to SD card - FAIL. May only read one [1], article 
per month w/o a paid upgrade - charge (that reoccurrs). All while STILL 
wading in paid services (advertisement). FAIL. Muy Disappointed",0
"Can't get my highlights to stick. They keep disappearing a few seconds 
after I mark them.",0
Need to pay to read more. :/,0
"... It's good that the app is improving, but what is the necessity of 
having a brightness override that can't be turned off to auto?!",0
"I accidentally remove some part of my draft and there's no any option to 
undo or discard changes.",0
"Not enough user control over what displats in my feed. How can i lrt the 
app know what i like and dont like. Interests feature is not enough. 
Uninstallled.",0
"I just uninstalled it because I can't read anything without paying anymore 
:/",0
Please pay premium to unlock more stars,0
"No offline mode. To me that's a deal breaker because I travel a lot and I 
want to make a list if read later articles I can open without data. I get a 
lot of failed to load errors as well,noy sure why. Following interests 
don't update. I click following, Exit the app, reopen and it shows like I'm 
not following any. Would be great to be able to change the font size. Apart 
from these issues, the content is awesome but no usable for me. Thanks for 
your feedback.",0
Looks like a poorly made webapp. Every time you switch apps it bounces you to the start screen and you can't pick up where you left off. You're better off using the website.,0
The UX for me is complex now. Earlier design was simple and sober.,0
"Designed so you are forced to subscribe and pay. No way of separating premium from free articles. Previews aren't even possible. Makes for a very annoying and uncomfortable experience being constantly reminded that you aren't paying..... ""You read a lot"".... Well I try, just need to skip all the subscription articles forced into my feed...",0
Used to be a lot better. Now you have to pay to read most of the stories aggregated to your news feed. This is a fine practice but I can't filter out the paid only articles from my feed and you won't know if you can read it or not until you open the article. Very annoying,0
"Extremely expensive. I would definitely buy it if had a once in a lifetime payment option, but currently they are asking for way to much money per month.",0
"I liked the idea of the application, but the applicaication have a bug, every time and then the application stops showing any article in the homepage and never update it, as if the internet is disconnected",0
"This app has great potential. But right now it's just over-loaded with far left op/ed. Angry, man-hating feminists, communists, etc. Writing that doesn't even try to be neutral, it's just pure hate. There needs to be a balance struck, until then, it falls short.",0
It was a very good app for following my interested topics. But now everything changes. I must pay for many articles. Many of them are free articles that you can read it for free if you search it in google. Ridiculous!,0
Headlines are cropped in the front page rendering it illegible.  Lacks readability options such as change font size.,0
"An app for reading stories, but only in landscape, in portrait the text is cropped. You can't choose font size. Nor background colour. Definitely a bad reader. Love the content though 😀",0
"It updates daily, too often. Uninstalled, because it makes me think that bugs and problems are found constantly.",0
Too much paywall,0
"I used this happily for years but now recent ""improvements"" have made it much harder for me to keep up with the writing and comments of people in my network. Perhaps they will fix it, in which case I will be glad to edit this, because the site itself is one of the few intelligent places on the internet.",0
"Could not figure out how to turn off stories that I am absolutely NOT interested in seeing. Other news feeds have a selection on each story that says something like ""do not show more stories related to xxxxxx"".",0
"Sometimes the text is not loaded and i can see only the pictures from the articles, or only half of the article's text is loaded and the rest is empty apart from pictures. This happens on both wifi or mobile data connections.",0
Pretty annoying how I mostly see member-exclusive articles in my feed despite not being a member.,0
It tries too hard to make me subscribe. Too many 'members only' articles in my list. Like blocks of 20 in a row with a few free ones in between,0
"The clap button isn't square, but elliptical and the clap function itself doesn't work (the claps don't save)",0
Not much too read without membership.,0
recommendation is too narrow,0
"The app started out good. They killed it with each update. Right now my home screen in a list of their ""featured stories"". Nothing from my interests or channels I follow. I couldn't find anything worth reading in the featured section. That's been the case for a while. So disappointing.",0
A few months ago i would give 5 stars but after the last update I can'read almost anything other than premium stories.,0
"So buggy and laggy, there are no elementary reading settings, I'm very disappointed",0
"I try to log in using my Google account but the app just returns a ""We can't log you in, please try again"" message.",0
Claps don't save when I do them in the app. I have to use the mobile browser instead.,0
Force closes every time I try to open my profile. Kindly fix this bug.,0
"I can't login to my account, it keeps saying sorry could not log you in",0
Eat my battery.,0
"I love the content but the UI is lackluster and unpolished. They require you to upgrade after reading about 120 articles, which for someone learning, that's not much at all. I thought I found gold when I found medium; instead its just a huge chunk of fools gold. (not to mention, my last $5 in my student checking account is NOT going to pay for a subscription to learn even more.) You should think about the less fortunate every now and then.",0
Good content but the code samples are unreadable because the font is too small and the contrast is very poor. Renders the app unusable.,0
"Can't use App because I can't use the Google Sign in capability... ""We couldn't log you in, please try again later"" has been happening for a week",0
No functionality for series. That really sux,0
The app cannot login with Google,0
New feature Series is still iOS only. That kinda sucks.,0
Unable to login,0
"I love medium, but the app makes me sad. It crashes everytime I try scrolling down any profile. I have tried reinstalling but it didn't help. I think I should resort to web browser for medium.",0
The app is not opening  and started showing me blank page.it's not letting me sign in after reinstalling and trying to sign up or sign in.,0
The is tough to even sign up.. how the hell do I enter it?? Sign in using Gmail and other  don't work.,0
"IMHO, the Android app must need a lot work in UX. Intrusive animations and confusing motions are degrading what Medium intends to be.",0
"I uninstalled recently due to memoru space, then I installed again, but it doesn't let me sign it. WHY???",0
"Não consigo fazer desinstalação do aplicativo. Acontece algum erro na hora... tentei pelo jeito tradicional e pelo administrador de arquivos, mas nada.",0
I can't sign up and i don't know why ...plz tell me wt to do,0
Can't get notifications for new stories from entities I follow,0
"The Series feature is still not available for Android, the only reason I had installed this app, because everything else on Medium is available *and better* from a browser.",0
Giving same error while logging in; we couldn't login you in please try again.,0
"New review: I want to upgrade and pay but I always find an ever spinning wheel with a retry button. Guys pls get your things together, this is the most important flow for your business.  Also I'm very frustrated by stories heavy on images, they're extremely slow to load compared to same story  on Chrome without acceleration.  Old review :There's a weird bug when rotating the screen back and forth, I'm not sure how to reproduce but happens quite often.",0
"Mobile version show only few articles, consume to much data for an article with a couple of images.",0
Liked it way more before with the previous interface and no paid membership,0
"The mobile app is not as good as the web version. We do not get to see more stories, nor do we get to know if that's the end of stories. We can also not undo many changes which are possible on the web version. Editing is tough. Maybe it's oy good to read on the mobile version but even in that we don't get access to all the existing stories.",0
Great content but this app suck. There is minor bugs that need to be fixed and there should be ability to read storys that are in reading,0
"Paywall after a very limited number of articles makes this app of limited 
utility to me. I appreciate that ""people like to get paid"" but there are 
too many free sources of news and other apps have been able to deliver that 
for free via add revenue. Not for me.",0
No way to get back to the home screen without pressing back repeatedly.  Doesn't seem to have a fully-fledged feed like the web version does.,0
"I'm missing ""recently read"" option. Color background options. Font size/font style Reorder topic at home",0
"Uninstalling. It has you pick topics that you're interested in, and then it still shows you things that you don't want to see. I wish there was a I don't want to see things like this option on articles. I kept getting articles on politics and I didn't want to see anything about politics I just want to space where I can read things I want to read and have a separate space for politics.",0
"Well, I bought into the Read More hype only to learn that a lot of the content is locked unless I pay for a subscription. I was excited to hopefully have some new content but I'll be looking elsewhere.",0
Mostly fluff opinion pieces and not much news,0
It doesn't work on wifi.,0
cant sign in or sign up,0
"Amazing platform, tons of great content. I used to love it, but the categories I follow have become saturated by two large publishers drowning out the smaller voices. It's beginning to feel more like Facebook, an endless sea of clickbait interrupted briefly by the content you actually want.  Possible solution: please add a ""Mute publisher/author"" feature. I would love you forever.",0
Not intuitive. Buggy. Notifications don't work at ALL on my Android device - only works on the iPad. So as an Android user the experience is bad.,0
"App is very badly designed. It's impossible to get from an article back to the main page if you opened it from a link, it's impossible to browse articles that aren't on your specific list",0
"From the reader's perspective the app offers inferior experience to the 
mobile web, I've found it to be generally slower and unreliable with spotty 
connection. Articles are not cached for offline reading and the app does 
not remember the last open article or even the scroll position within the 
article. With removal of the History of read articles and introduction of 
offline reading only for subscribers, this app is vastly inferior to apps 
like Pocket or Instapaper.",0
"The design is ridiculous. Reading mode is the worst among all readers I've ever encountered. Who even needs status bar with only some information hidden? And who needs ghosts of navigation bar? No, thanks. The app itself is not looking good and obviously not optimised. The new post and clap icons are just... torn I would say. Overall inner features look unnecessarily big. Liked the content, but the app... And you want someone to pay for this? No way",0
"The idea behind the app is amazing, lots of fun articles. But the app is buggy, works one time, hangs and doesn't load anything lots of times. (Sony Z5 compact, Android 7.1.1)",0
"On Android version 7.1.1, No way to format text. Bold and italic not showing when text is highlighted",0
Grrr. All my readers think I've published a whole new article ('Story') when really it's just a couple of words comment on someone else's article! Great. Now all my real articles are lost in a huge list of random comments I've made across Medium. Why hasn't this been fixed yet? I can't understand why it would be designed this way?,0
Can you let me know why I cannot share my blog for days now?  It reverts to the home screen every time I attempt to share or it says Android has stopped.  I tried uninstall-instalk but to no avail!,0
What the heck happened to the app icon? It sticks out like a sore thumb. With no drop shadow it blends into the background and really looks off.,0
"Medium ruined the app for a while, but they've added in the 'You might like section' which totally fits my needs again! Changing my review from 2 to 5 stars",0
"Bring back the old Icon,  or create something good, this logo is really s*&#s, I don't know who even created this logo and who got the guts to upload it and roll out a update with it.😵😵😵",0
"Hey, what's up medium? Ugly looking logo and where did stories/series go????",0
"No ability no disable inapp browser is driving me mad — I'm used to close browser when I don't need it, but with this workflow I just close whole app. So I have to reopen Medium, find article, find place, where I stop.",0
New update : One brave step forward Two huge steps backwards.... *claps*,0
Please at least round the corners of the icon. Otherwise it looks like some  amateur app,0
I am uninstalling the app because I don't like the new logo.,0
I don't like the 'new' logo...,0
"Where the hell is series tabs, I can't find it in this new update, the icons was fine but SERIES..",0
"There is a problem with this app, where reading any article using TalkBack is very slow.",0
very bad user experience ana user interface design,0
"I use the app every day, and since you changed the front feed I never get recomendations for things I actually like. Please make an option to opt-out of this new feed! Otherwise the app is grate",0
Doesn't allow me to sign in using my Google account unless I grant it access to my contact list. Uninstalled.,0
"Let's accept it, it's not even close to Flipboard.",0
"I love medium ... on desktop. The mobile app was amazing, with an intuitive and clean UI. What the hell is going on now. With buttons not centered with messed up border radiuses, random tinder like sliders, grids that look strange. We come to medium just to read, the content is what makes it great and the simple UI made sure the user appreciated that. This new UI makes it feel like medium is supposed to be some cool app with unique features. I am far from conservative but this new look needs to be re done. Other than that medium is litttt.",0
terrible ux. takes 4 taps through  nonintuitive menus to get to the list of people you follow. doesn't remember last article opened.,0
Why i can't upload my photos? At first i thought it was my connection. But i'm sure it wasn't. So what is wrong?,0
"The app is not working anymore, I don't know why. I thought may be it needs to be updated but when I checked it was already updated.",0
Quotes are not showing when night mode is on. Please fix this and I'll rate 5 stars,0
Thought it was OK at first but unfortunately it leans a little too much to the left for my liking.,0
The app looks good and is easy to use but most of the articles are behind a paywall.,0
"As pointed out by many other reviews, latest changes have really ruined the medium experience. I used to enjoy seeing lots of articles based on my interests, but now it's hard to find almost anything. There is no way to get rid of all 'recommended by us' articles that i simply have no interest in whatsoever. Real shame.",0
Very annoying when the app crashes after typing an elaborate comment and everything is gone! It happened exactly when I tried to select my text to make a copy as backup. Ironic,0
Was much better before the redesign. It used to provide a wide array of interesting articles. Now it shows me either articles I've already read or totally irrelevant stories. I miss the old Medium.,0
"I can't get to the signup form.  I click Get Started, then it pretends to think about something, then quits and shows the ""get started"" button again",0
News feed is unpleasant and the guide to turn back old feed does not help.,0
Not a fan of the new layout.  I've noticed that I don't use it as much as before.,0
Prior version was good .It had nice font with good spaces between each words .The previous logo was good .Change the font to previous one .,0
This latest UI change basically made the app unusable. It was easy to find and discover the kind of stuff I wanted to see. Now it's recommending articles I've already read and bookmarked. Why recommend something I've saved to read later? I won't be using this anymore,0
"I've found some UI bugs, namely the floating action buttons. The ""Like"" and the ""get article to read(?)"" buttons are somewhat deformed. While the ""Like"" one stretches vertically to look like an egg, the other one has a flattened out bottom. Seems very odd to me, I'd attach some screenshots for easier explanations but there is no way yo provide feedback in app.",0
Sorry to say but the latest version is very disappointing. It's really difficult to browse and find new things to read which was the whole point of Medium to me.   They also have random subscriber only content scattered in between everything so you have to constantly check and see whether that article that looks interesting is free to read or not. And then stuff you bookmarked is all at the bottom of the page. It makes no sense and judging from the reviews others feel the same. If there's not a better update soon I think I'll be deleting this app.,0
"I wanted to try out this platform as it was getting good feedback, so I installed the app. But sadly, the app gets stuck at the initial screen after launch. I waited for 5 min, even tried reinstalling the app, but to no avail.  Seems something went wrong in the launch screen initialization guys. Better take a look before more low ratings arrive.",0
You can't install app without granting permission to access contacts. So I don't install app; I just read articles in the Internet. It's slightly less efficient but my privacy is well worth the price.,0
"Used to love this app but now it doesn't even work for some reason, I can't login and because of that I can't access the app! (Asus Zenfone 3 Max)",0
"Can't write a post, only comments and confusing navigation",0
Not able to upload an image in my article....its always processing after selecting an image from gallery,0
No Highlighter! I might as well use the web app,0
"I love medium and it pains me to give it two stars but the fact that it's not updated to support the new series functionality is a huge flaw for me. I was ecstatic about the idea and couldn't wait to experiment with it. Unfortunately, if you're on Android you can't create a series,  view the videos included in a series, or fully experience the parallax images in a series. I'll rate the app five stars when it's fixed but for now I can't justify anything higher than a 2 star rating.",0
"I would say that the app version is bad in my phone. Bookmark is not working, so I lost all articles that I've read. Some pages also buggy. Then, I sometimes found force close",0
Nexus 5X. Android 7.1.2.  Videos and images do not load. I'm unable to update my profile picture. I'm unable to link my Facebook account.,0
"2 stars for the lack of a data saving feature, as this app eats a lot of it.   Also, update release notes would be appreciated.",0
Didn't see the value for the membership.   Money making idea not a passion.....suspect MSM trying to morph itself.,0
I dont have credit card how will you pay me,0
Loaded app three days ago. Since first launching the application no news articles have updated. Not great. Had promise,0
Do you have a server problem? I can't even browse an article. Kindly fix.,0
Can't submit to publications from your phone.,0
"It asks for contacts, if you login via Google.  Login externally, and no permissions required.  Still. A bad idea. To have it access contacts. Why do you need to?   Stories are good. But lack credibility. Since they're not reporters, there's no way to cross check and confirm them.  The app itself is very heavy. Consumers a sufficient amount of data and is very slow.  People need fast apps to read stories. And not everyone wants to read all the of story. Starting with a good gist will be a better idea.",0
"Shame there is no way to load images on tap, just all or nothing 😡 (and ""all"" means it will eat my data plan in few days)",0
Getting too many notifications when I have only opted for a daily summary. Please fix that,0
"The home feed stays the same, no matter who I follow or whether I refresh.",0
Good content but no offline support :/,0
I cannot login. Just stays busy... :-(,0
I liked the app but after too many silent crashes when viewing articles I've decided to uninstall.,0
"There are so many articles that are locked, seriously. Can't find anything to read these days. Everything is locked. Smh  My history only shows reads from 5 days ago and more. I want to visit an article I was just reading but it's not in my history.",0
"It's a nice app, but apparently the latest update doesn't let you submit articles to publications. I've spent two days trying to figure this out.",0
Why I cant sign up or use my twitter acc?,0
Connot login with Android 7.,0
Crashes a lot,0
"Hello there, I can't sign up. It says error. Been trying for few times but still not working. I will re-review once the problem solved. thanks",0
"Excellent community, but application ate a lot of my mobile data in the background.",0
Suddenly I'm logged out of my account and I can't log back using either my Gmail or Twitter. Please help! I can't even creat a new account!,0
"I really wanted to like you, Medium. But between the lack of offline reading and the useless follow (why does half the stuff never show up at all) I just can't justify even a single MB you eat up on my devices. I might still check in on the browser every once in a while.",0
"Used to be pretty good, but it keeps getting worse... Image zooming and/or sliding doesnt work, its laggy, and since last update I can't open multiple articles at once. I used to go through my newsletter email and open all articles that i found interesting and then went through them and read them. Now I am forced to leave my inbox read article, return to it and repeat. Can't be bothered",0
"Navigation has never been a strong point for Medium, particularly where responses are concerned. However, what really bugs me now about the app is the unreliable recommends system—sometimes an article I recommend stays recommended, but many times it doesn't and when I go back to that article it's as though I never read it. Given how lousy the search function is in Medium, it's very annoying to find my Recommends feed is missing half the stickers I've read on the past few weeks.",0
Android app is not as stable as website. Snippets or Images are not showing in articles most of the time. Initially I was thinking it as my network issue. But it's not as I can see YouTube videos without any buffering with the same network.,0
Missing important feature of any content app. Scroll back to top.,0
"I can't add response through mobile app??? Medium is FULL of people showing off how they are the best programmer out there (they're not) and this app itself can't do something basic? And what the hell is up with ""we have emailed you a linl to sign in""?? Let me just enter my password oh my god!!",0
Zoom and panning on photos isn't quite a nice experience. .. Needs to implement a faster scroll for long articles.,0
Losing credentials on upgrade is not a good practice.,0
"Installed and read 1 article, the app has somehow downloaded 180mb of data not including the app package. I think I'll just use pocket to offline the articles I want to read.",0
I'd rather uninstall the app than give you my contacts!,0
"+ could you please fill in the ""what's new"" section when releasing a new app version? | Good product but.. how comes nothing is preloaded when no connection? Not even bookmarked articles? What about an offline mode?",0
"I used to love this app. Then there was an update and now I can't log in unless I allow it to access my contacts. Why exactly does medium need my contacts list? And if I say no, why does it refuse to log me in? No medium, I will not allow you to force me to give you that information. So I uninstalled your app. If you ever fix it to behave ethically, I'll happily reinstall it again.",0
Couldn't get past the getting started page to find what I wanted to read because there was no way to skip selecting interests. App looked nice but I just wanted to discover articles on my own and without choosing interest buckets.,0
"App lost my account details. There's no easy way to work out which of the 4 login options my account might be under, nor can I use the app without it. Developer's email address doesn't exist (error 550), so I assume this app is unsupported/abandoned.",0
This app is really social justice leaning. All I wanted was news about technology but most of the articles are picked to cater to ultra liberals,0
"Full of bugs and shoddy UI, please fix it soon so that I may enjoy your great content on my m mobile devices too!",0
Fix your app please. I can't load any interests or tags I've followed.,0
"Wait, now I have to give access to my contacts in order to use Google to sign in to Medium? You're kidding.",0
No action made for the black dash inside the app while scrolling in Galaxy S7 Edge. The contents are so good but the app is just mediocre.,0
Relies heavily on data usage. Should probably consider compression of image and also cache of articles. Finding it Difficult to read a article without proper internet connection.,0
Requires viewing your contacts. Totally unnecessary. Just add the website to your home screen through Chrome. Same experience without the data snooping.,0
"Amateur quality. Links don't always open, UI elements not always aligned properly, and lots of other hallmark signs of incompetence or carelessness.",0
"I can not upload my stories. Every time I click publish, a pop up shows and ask me to write the tag. But at the bottom of the pop up, there is just ""not yet"" button. I keep coming back to my draft. Am I doing it wrong?",0
Infested with social justice warriors and ignoramuses doubling as wannabe writers. Gave it an extra star because of the pleasant design but thats about it.,0
"When you click on newsletters, the app is launched and then you're back in the mail. And sometimes you launch the app, spinning wheel, and the blank screen....",0
Image frequently not loaded. Uninstalled.,0

Medium is not able to find medium,0
Buzzfeed alternative,0
You can never really get discovered,0
"I just want to read from my selected list of following, not the default crap. There is no way to unfollow default content",0
Unable to sign in.,0
Old ui was better and simple,0
"Content could be great, but I'm not willing to give it unrestricted access to my full address book in advance. Unfortunately, I can't read anything at all without doing so.",0
"Your mobile site feels smoother than the app (say when scrolling through an article). That's a big red flag; reduces the incentive to use an app instead of a browser tab. And yes, you cannot scroll zoomed in images which makes the ability to zoom in slightly pointless.",0
No RTL support at all!,0
Not sure,0
"The idea is great but the app is horrible. You can't personalize it, because if you like a post, posts by and liked by the people you liked will appear on your TL even if you aren't interested in them. They won't disappear if you unlike the post or the person. And it's really hard to manage your interests, so there's a lot of topic in my TL in which I'm not interested but that I can't remove.",0
"App is broken. I could not sign in into my account. Tried Google, Twitter and FB none of the sign in options work.",0
Cant sign up or log in./.  Android Note 5.,0
Please look into this matter. I have installed and unistalled many times. Cant seem to log in thru mobile phone,0
"I really like the medium platform and have read a lot of articles mainly in the coding sections. I thought I would give the app a try but I'm very disappointed to see that you have to give access to your contacts if you want to login! The only purpose for that would be to mine your customers, I say no thank you!",0
"The vision for Medium and especially it's app reveals a closed-minded company view. They refuse to disclose what each app update adds or fixes, they release Series as a half-baked idea with no support for creating content on 80% of the world's devices!? The app gobbles data and has little in the way of customization or features that might make the experience fun or enjoyable. If you like closed-wall apps with a 'do it our way or no way' philosophy then you might enjoy the Medium app experience.",0
Exactly.,0
"I can't log in to my account via Twitter and when I do, it keeps saying no connection but my internet is fine. Another thing is that the website for this can't be load at all. It keeps saying the site can't be reached. Please fix it. I enjoy reading the articles and I want to keep reading it. Their inspirational. I would give it a five after everything is fix",0
"Tried to read some articles and every single one of them closes after a minute or so. Looks like the OOM killer does it, but that shouldn't be the case because other similar apps work fine.",0
I tried to sign in with my google account because that's how I signed up in the first place and the app said it is unable to do so. I tried making a new account with all 4 ways and I still can't get through,0
Unable to sign in with any of the options given. Please resolve this.,0
Default notifications are annoying,0
"I tagged the ringer to follow, but can never seem to find the latest articles from the ringer.",0
Laziest loading,0
"I cannot see editor's notes from the app at all, not mention to correct them. At all. It is no way to do it from the cell phone. Opening m.site is a pain, because I am always redirected to the app. And even after I managed to open m.site, I cannot see and process the notes correctly, they are not highlighted. I am traveling and should correct the editor's notes for my submission and there is no way I could do it! Upsetting.",0
"Also, when opting not to download images it displays huge grey boxes instead... What?",0
I am unable to sign in.I have tried many times.Plz see to that,0
Always force close on my oneplus one,0
Keeps telling me I'm signed out.,0
I can't sign it. Tried a bunch of times. It won't work,0
"The content is still awesome and worth the subscription. But what is this new logo? Also, often text elements are not displayed properly and do not scale to the width of my device. This makes reading on my phone a pain - too bad that it's the main device I use Medium on. -1 The issues with scrolling horizontally when looking at code persists. The slightest lateral movement blocks the horizontal scroll. Both should work simulatiouly. -1 No dark mode for the code.",1
"Good. But as a writer I miss more advanced features when it comes to content publishing - the app doesn't allow one to add stories to publications, neither publish comfortably and completely. It also needs more development when it comes to accessing full stats and settings. Otherwise, good for reading stories. So generally good enough for readers only.",1
"I used to like medium, but lately it has turned into a marketing platform. And the ""new"" stolen icon, what where you thinking?",1
"Less user friendly ... Like after opening up it should show up with popups like, from here you can do this from there you can do that. Some guidance for the app interface. Also key features of app like how to follow or search in your industry I'm searching from past 10 minutes where to find all the top researchers and follow them all in one tap. In linkedin we have this feature follow whole group of people at once of your desired industry.",1
"The new app is much better what it was before, but its super buggy.i cant seem to search at all",1
The registration is fast and smooth except for the space provided for debit card is small.what the site stands for is awesome and if you a good reader and writer there is a lot of room for improvement.questions are answered quickly with a lot of courtesy.it improves your knowledge and task your iQ for more.,1
"This used to be such a great app. With the recent ui changes, it takes a long time to load articles and sometimes they Don't load at all. The fancy ui destroys the primary purpose of the app.",1
"This apps is so much good and I have pleasure on writing here, but why when I edit something like the title of my article, the edit is just can be seen on me, but when other people open my blog, the title still the old one :'(",1
"I'll rate 5 stars when you make it possible to remove an ""Applause"" (?) given erroneously, rather than just adding more and more. I gave an extremely poorly written article +7 because I was unfamiliar with the function.",1
Great platform for a lot of insightful and eye catching articles.However it would be better if the user would be allowed to view all articles for free or there should be increase in number of free articles which the user can read for a month.,1
Why is it that I don't receive alerts when a new story from someone I follow comes out? Is there anything I can do? There are graphic glitches while using the dark mode too.,1
Seamless experience and easy user interface. I like the option of connecting your facebook and twitter accounts.. Thumbs up. Please keep it up.,1
So many articles on premium which you can't read,1
"Needs better filtering/browsing options. I prefer no politics on medium, yet many recommended stories are biased politics.",1
I would like to have more control over the content that I'm seing. I think I see to much content that exactly matches my interests. This deprives me of the opportunity to read articles that might widen my horizon.,1
Pls why is it always telling me to start a free trial. I downloaded the app so i can get the articles for free. But now i can't even read anything . But apart from that i prefer it to social media by far,1
"I wish you had better solution for comments under articles. The system you have now is pretty confusing. The same applies for your web. Additionally I wish there would be a possibility to disable some topics like BLM, racism, finger pointing etc. It's getting tiresome. Thank you.",1
"I like to read in light mode even if I have enabled dark mode in my phone, so I always turn off dark mode in reading apps whenever is possible. Why is turning dark mode off still dark?",1
"Medium platform is great, but since the latest upgrade the app keeps crashing on my OnePlus device whenever I try to open an article",1
Your App is really good but it is not accepting the payment from my cards. I tried from three different atm cards. (May in india it is not valid),1
"I'm not sure 3 articles for a months is enough, I means the UI is nice and clean but... I'm not sure how describe it.",1
"Things that should be added/improved. 1. Comment on post 2. Highlight in the post 3. See followers of Publications. 4. Tabs for Home, Popular, etc. 5. Claps are not working. Very bad experience.",1
Useful articles. Additional links supporting narratives would be more helpful. Thank,1
"the app needs you to pay to read articles and i absolutely hate it, though the articles are really interesting.",1
Definite left wing platform. Would love the AI in the background to push some diversity into my profile.,1
"Interesting articles, but not always the best writers.",1
Its good app....actually i started using it recently thats why 3 stars...lets see....how it works further,1
Great and quality app coz poemia and all are not qualitative for reading it's a good option but if we say on posting point of view then not so much reviews happens . U need to buy them and you can't read post too for reading posts pocket is too good.,1
I LOVE the articles & Writers ARE Brilliant!👍 What I HATE IS that I'm LIMITED to articles that I read because I DON'T UPGRADE & PAY MONEY to app! 👎,1
It is nice and I love to read in medium... The only problem is Indians can't publish their stories and earn in medium even though 7% and above people are reading from India... I am a techy and I like to make a new app like medium in India... So the things will change...,1
its really frustating only to get 5 free stories per month,1
Why almost all valuable and promising articles are under paid subscription? Free articles are not quite worthwhile. No offence,1
Im migrating to other options because i dont want to pay it seems like every article i click on now requires subscription not all articles are high quality even if the title is clickbait,1
"Hard to find fellow authors or specific posts which I have web urls of, on the app.",1
Lovely articles. Looking forward to seeing great topics of interest in the future,1
"Formatting experience isn't good. Many times people write in microsoft word in desktop because that's a different feel but to publish on medium while copying the content from word to medium app isn't a rich experience. Improve it asap as obviously one won't write the whole content on medium writing space. Also, include picture crop feature and its spacing adjust feature in app just like word.",1
I've just sent three examples from my Outlook email address. Thanks,1
I thought Medium was free. No ads said it was pay to read. Then they send you articles you have pay to read.,1
"Used to be solid, but for the past few months now, I'm having trouble reading articles opened via external links. I always end up on the home page instead of the article I wanted to read. Clearing the cache/ reinstalling didn't fix this.",1
Provide translation similar to Twitter.,1
"It has been a love-hate relation with the app. On some days the suggestions are excellent. However, that isn't adjusted basis the changes in Interests section. After reading similar articles for 2-3 days, the same continued for weeks! Despite trying to make changes. It would help if suggestions are tuned better to the reader preferences. If needed, give us an option for a clean slate/reset - remove all preferences/saved cookies in a way - and select new interests",1
"Overall experience is good but when I open any link to medium post from other apps it opens in chrome, and from that screen when I select open in app to bookmark it, it says no internet connection even though it's connected to internet. So I have to open medium app again, find the author and after that find that particular post to bookmark it. Kindly address this issue as soons as possible.",1
Nice app for both amateur and experienced writers,1
I really enjoy this app. The articles are well-written & interesting and there is a large variety of subjects to choose from. The only issue is that I can't read more than two a month unless I pay & I'm not willing to pay when I can find the same kind of information free on the internet.,1
I have tend to use it less. I think limit on articles have created kind of negative impact. I understand one must pay for curated content as lots of people's hardwork is put into it. But some how the way it is put introduced have pushed me back. As a reader and as a writer too.,1
Very good app to read quality stuff,1
"The app could allow for atleast 10 free articles per month and recommend content for free articles. Secondly, I feel that subscription fee is a bit expensive. They could have rolled out for Rs. 1000 per year. But the quality of the content is superb.",1
"The stories are great, but this review is about the app experience. I find it seriously irritating that I must receive an email every time that I use the site. Every time in my browser and joining the app. Why can't we use a password like any normal site.",1
"I like Medium but it doesn't have the ability to filter free articles from premium articles. If I enjoy enough content for free, I'm willing to pay.",1
"This is a good app that collects all the news you like to read in one place. However, asking for a membership for the content that I can read in my browser for free is quite disappointing! I think this app and apps like this should be absolutely free!",1
İt's a great app with lots of good content. But the fact that almost all the good articles are started we cannot reach most of them. i think you should consider encouraging writers about creating more content for free. Otherwise it's a pay and read app.,1
"I'm able to read a lot of articles about numerous topics and my own interests. It's a great place to read different types of articles. It's easy to use and it has a clean interface. However, there was only a limited number of free articles I can read. It sucks how I have to pay.",1
"I love this app, but the limit on free articles is too extreme and makes it frustrating. I wish it were add-based or donation-based instead of a subscription that makes it inaccessible to a lot of the people who would most benefit from it.",1
"It's nice to have a look at the topics you like and the wide of styles from the different writers, that's why I'd love to have more chances to read more articles in the free version. Thanks for everything though! :)",1
"its a great app for articles ,built in a nice way and all but the only reason im not giving it a 5 stars is after reading the first article its no longer for free you have to pay for it and become a member , i would rather see some ads than to pay monthly . :/",1
"There is a huge supply of information but fewer readers. As a reader, the platform deserves 5 star but as a writer, they really need to up their online presence. It is yet to become the top 5-10 search results on relevant topics when googled.",1
Medium platform is really helpful. I like the contribution that people make here. Unfortunately the app forces user for subscription and does not allow you to proceed ahead read even a small blog or article before you subscribe which is very annoying.,1
Works pretty well though some articles are cut off on the sides of my screen. I.e. the text doesn't wrap properly. Content is great though but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be rating that or just the app performance?,1
"When opening a premium post from the daily push notification, you'll have one less premium story without ever recieving a warning... I understand that you need an income and want people to subscribe for that, but this is not a very nice way of encouraging that :)",1
This app is great runs perfectly the only problem i have is subscription guys put ads for free users something else for revenue one month trial works great for netflix etc not for apps like this. For none reader like me its discouragement,1
"I just downloaded it and I am trying to sign in. i get the code in my email a few seconds later and when I try to sign it, it says that the link has expired. This has happened over 5 times now. Please fix it.",1
"I used to love this app. While I understand the need to monitize the app, if I am not a paying customer, why do all my recommended articles locked behind a pay wall? I don't understand why I don't just get the free ones.",1
"The app is quite alright, I'm finding it difficult to upload a picture from my gallery, it's showing ""!"" and it's blurry, please fix this bug immediately and I'll give it 5 stars..thank you",1
Pay wall to read articles: If this was a site where only professional journalist posted articles then I can see putting a pay wall for reading but honestly most of the articles on here are what you would find in a blog post or several other websites. Maybe consider an ad model along with subscription and let the user choose if they want to deal with ads or pay for articles.,1
So far I am enjoying the app. However I am not able to archive my favourite articles. I bookmarked them but unable to see them.,1
"It's a great app for avid readers ... Anyone would enjoy they bring up interesting topics all the time so, there is no room for boredom here. Great App!",1
"Good app, but for some topics it is asking payment that I didn't like.",1
It's amazing the number of leftist or incredibly left leaning posts that get promoted on medium. I cannot complain about the quality of the content but the distinct lack of opposing opinions showing up as promoted makes me wonder about the platform.,1
"Platform is great but app needs improvement. 3 dot option next to publish is not visible. As a result, i am unable to add my work to other publications.",1
"Like the app, but it has started not letting me upload photos to stories from the app. Also, there's no way to filter out responses from stories in the app.",1
"Love this app, but not enough to start paying for it when I can find similar articles anywhere else for free.",1
"Actually i love reading but the fact that u need to upgrade as soon u reach the limit of the article u read, its frustrating so i decided to give it a 3star.",1
Best blogging app but how to add gallery and custom tabs to my blog app and how to make more than one blog channel. The font family of this app is not good. I want more font-families.,1
"Seems like an informative app, but there's a forced subscription so you can't use it without signing up.",1
"Drafts do not loading, can you help me they dont working? show ""Failed fetching stories"" what happen? help me please!",1
"It needs an update,because I can't add image caption to publish my story",1
"It was good, now you guys just want a huge load of money to provide articles . And the cost is way too high for anyone .",1
The app is good but I am facing a problem whenever I try to upload a picture in my story..the picture is not getting uploaded..,1
Steep learning curve as you try to navigate from one area to another.,1
Amazing app. But I really wish it was free or at has more limit to read.,1
"I love to read, but I don't have money to pay to subscribe to reading it often. This is really hurtful as I always improvise how to read free daily .",1
Most articles can't be read without a subscription which is a shame.,1
Not good so far i down loaded the app but it seems to do is ask you to rate something you haven't even got to try. Thinking about uninstalling nexar allread,1
"The content is acceptable, but the images aren't displayed .",1
"It's interesting.To look at.like a museum.....no interactive creation""tivity"".too bad,😥",1
Notifications are shown only while opening the app. Fix it.,1
Sadly got to buy the subscription after 3 or 4 article. Receive the news letter in my inbox and so many articles seem good. So it's really a tease. What is the ratio that go to the article creator?,1
"Read a few older articles for free, need a subscription to read others.",1
Give more time to read the recommended articles that are on the home page. Please,1
Inserting an image is an impossible task using this app. Please fix it ASAP,1
Covered with great stories 👍,1
Some of content is left wing oriented. Should be more objective,1
Paywall did not allow me to use the app effectively communicate,1
No option to display free articles only.,1
Provide inbuilt Google translations.,1
"As a writer, editor, and student of the living world, I welcome insights on topics of particular interest to me from (mostly) talented writers. I hesitate to provide my own work due to UI limitations. Also I know for a fact that I have NOT read all 5 articles allotted to me as a non premium subscriber, and that is problematic at best. I need more access to articles before I become a paying member. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1
"I love that Medium gives me a ""voice"" with it, I can reach the world from my little corner. Though there is a glitch every time I try to upload pictures, my keyboard just disappears. But other than that great app!!!",1
"I like the content on Medium but the app is quite basic. For example, I can't sync saved stories between my phone and tablet, the UI isn't very comfortable (why can't I dismiss a story with a swipe function). Would be happy to see some user interface improvements.",1
"After using it for some time it is asking to go for payment to unlock readings. There are other platforms provide free readings atleast. So I stopped using this application and this website. Medium can start looking for other monetization strategy, atleast not for readings.",1
Too much pay to view more kind of baits,1
"Decent content for sure but the free version is basically useless, as the vast majority of content is limited to the premium version after your 2 free articles for the month. And the price is a little high to me. Why not have ads on the free version or a single time purchase not really a fan of everything having to be a monthly subscription.",1
Before that subscription thing this is the best app I ever encountered,1
You warned me would start billing me so I had to stop. Enjoyed the story. I was told ahead of time and I appreciate that. I know the stories are worth it.+😁.,1
"The medium app is pretty good for writing and reading stories of different niche. But I have an issue with writing on the app, I'm unable to add captions to the pictures I uploaded and most times, the keyboard disappears that I have to reopen the application again. Is there anything that can fix this? Thank you",1
"Well, it's a practically good app for writers and people who value to express their ideas and opinions in writings. Very great app that recognizes the importance of those who love to hold and use their pens!✊✊✊ Unfortunately, one cannot get paid in Tanzania since it's not yet available. I hope changes are made soon enough so that people from Africa can benefit from it as well.",1
"The content on Medium is diverse, dynamic enjoyable and worth sharing. The front page of the app, however, persistently showed similar articles not relevant to my geological location or interests I selected. The daily recommendations irritated me after a few days and offered nothing valuable to my thinking. Searching for articles, too, did not seem intuitive. Consequently, I uninstalled the app. I'll continue, though, to read articles from Medium in the future.",1
"The articles are interesting. But the only drawback, only few articles will be available for the reader unless you pay for upgrading. The income can be increased through ads rather than these pay and read option. It will be more comfortable for readers if the articles are offered for free.",1
Why my account is under investigation. I didn't violate any rules. Please fix that issue,1
Why do I need the app to comment on the mobile website version 😭😭😭. I am glad I have a phone with space for apps now (unlike my previous on a budget device) but I can see how that feature can disadvantage creatives. Please fix that.,1
"This app provides valuable information but is not free, hence 3 stars. There are other websites which are as good as this but are free.",1
"I find this to be a somewhat tedious app to work with. The biggest issue is the pop-the-stack mentality, meaning that if I pursue a series of interesting articles, I can find myself 5 or 10 layers down and there's no home button - just the back button moving me one step at a time. Why? Sometimes it's faster to simply quit the app to get to the home page. Similarly, in spite of the endless scroll model, there is no ""top"" button to let me go to the top of the page.",1
This is a really good app but the point is that its not free.people like are not accessed to international bank account to pay for a membership(bc of political problems and sanctions).its too bad i couldnt use it anymore.If you are looking for making money why dont u use commercials instead?,1
"Nice app, but misleading in the no ads tagline. No ads because you have to pay if you want to read more than three articles a month. Other aps do the same with the same quality for free, with unobtrusive ads.",1
"I love Medium, ever since I discovered it back in 2014/2015. I rapidly created a profile. I downloaded the app and I started writing and reading. And then I had to deal with the “5 articles a month” limit. And I got tired, so I left. App uninstalled. Now I'm back, still loving Medium, but disliking the “5 article a month” limit. I understand it though, why that limits is there. It's just an inconvenience for people like me (student) who can't afford to pay 5 $ a month, every month.",1
"I love Medium as a platform so much that I've upgraded my account to a paid subscription, it's an amazing platform. Unfortunately, the biggest flaw this app suffers from is not being able to perform advanced searches to filter or sort results. The front page is great to discover new content that others find interesting, but I can't search by 'most recent', which means I can never seek out truly new and unseen content. Without that feature, people can't be better informed.",1
Good app for everything in media,1
"Overall the reading experience is good but this app seems to lack some features. I was surprised to learn that there's no way to send private notes using the app. Also, the inability to know the list of articles that have been ready using the app is frustrating. As a consequence it's not possible for me to get back to an article i read before, just like how i do using my browsing history.",1
"I wanted to join the Medium Partner Program but no matter how much I tried clicking the ""Continue to payout setup"" button after agreeing to the Terms of Service, it doesn't proceed to the next step.",1
"Love the content which is quickly accessible via this app, but not being permitted to clip articles using Evernote is inexcusable. I am a paid user to both services. Why the limitation?? Also, I can't seem to bring up the author's profile when clicking on it. It just hangs with the circular status indicator going round and round on an almost blank page. I've left it running for several minutes like that with no resolution. Correct these two problems and I'll give this app 5 stars.",1
"The content is great (I mostly read about informatics) and the app is really agreable to use. However, free members have a limit of articles per month, and I'm fine with that. But the problem is that we've got nothing to manage it : I don't know how many free reads I have per month, nor how many article I already read and when will the count reset to 0. Because of that the app is unusable every second half of the month so 3 stars !",1
"i really love the app. it has helped me so much since I've started to learn web development. my only problem is, yoi can only read like 5 membership articles a month. i know its only 5 bucks a month, but it just seems very restricted compared to other article apps. maybe make it a weekly count or something. just food for thought i guess.",1
"I do love Medium ,Im working with the a free version of the moment. The one thing that caused me give only three stars, is the fact that they give you three free blog post to read a month, and that's great. the three stars were given because when you go in to check out to see if it's a story you want to read , even if you don't read it because it's not what you thought it was, they count that as a read. so actually every month I've had this I don't get to read any stories.",1
"This app has been very frustrating to use so far. There's very little that it has to get right, mainly just saving articles, archiving articles, and removing articles. But since I started using the paid version of the app, I've continued to have problems with saved articles coming back to my list after being deleted, or not showing up in my archive when I choose to archive the article. I really hope that the developers could sort out these syncing issues.",1
"Don't get me wrong, the app has marvellous quality content, so much that I was willing to purchase it's subscription; however, the interest/suggestion algorithms is TERRIBLE. After one or two ""business/marketing/self"" related articles I've read (which are not exactly what I'm into), the feed is FLOODED with these, and even unfollowing them and manually picking new trends won't stop that. Please fix it, the web version is SO much better compared to this...",1
"I have a habit of estimating the number of downloads of an app after using it. I was estiming around 10 M to 50M+ downloads. After using it more and more, I was sure that this app will not have more than 5M+ downloads for sure. You know why? “The paid membership” concept sucks a lot. It's not that we can't afford but, we have a ton of resources outside. Your app would have like 50M+ downloads if you've not introduced paid membership concept - now you have less than 5M downloads. Good one :)",1
"A clean app with great content. But just not worth enough for $5/month or $50/yr. For Indian market it's about ₹350/month, there are plenty of other valuable sources that are far more affordable and well worth the money. And only 3 to 4 free reads per month is criminal. Shame that such a good app is loosing its appeal among a huge market such as India. Hope the devs rethink the subscription model. To people who can afford this hefty price it's a good recommendation.",1
"I like the reminders, just don't want quite so many. If you""follow"" someone, it sends a reminder for EVERY article they write: daily, multiples daily etc. And I can't figure out how to remove this plethora of suggested time sucks from my reading list. So far the articles are ok. Some are garbage, but that's to be expected on the internet, especially with non-vetted material. Update: unsubscribed. That's not pro-rated either, so $$ gone. There are too many teaser advertorial style articles.",1
"Just not enough new content. I purchased a monthly subscription to try get the best out of the app experience but I just doesn't catch. Articles are rehashed of so many and there just wasn't enough sport & political topic for a non US person. Had to force myself to go into medium and try my best to get into it but with no success. I do think it has hope but for me, not now. It was over 2 months and maybe I didn't explore it enough but isn't that the real issue.",1
"I wish there was a different way for the app to make a profit. I was enjoying reading undiscovered, underground writers, it was refreshing, then BAM BLOCKED?!?! WHAT? I have to pay for a membership to read more 😮😕😔 I understand it's also about the bottom line but honestly I'd rather deal with ads then pay for a membership.",1
"Could be better. There's no doubt that you could read high quality stories here but something is missing. If I stumble upon a really good piece of writing that I want to save for future reference then there's only two options, archive it or put it into your reading list. But if I actively follow 'culture' and 'programming' and then some more and I feel like having a playlist like feature, something that'll let me create own custom lists of stories to review later on.",1
"App is very well designed. But content is a mixed bag. The initial recommendations are not great. Lots of click bait titles and ""x tips to make your life great"" type of articles. Might improve after collecting more data on my reading preference. But I just don't believe that I will get constant supply of really insightful articles with $5/month on this platform. Might check back in a few years.",1
"The actual writing content varies but is mostly very good. The app itself has a nice presentation but it's fiddly when it comes to making a reading list or archiving things. sometimes when you archive something, or remove it from archives, the change doesn't stick and it goes back to where it was before. GUI is nice and intuitive, settings are easy to use and helpful to improve the reading experience. Just needs to improve the archive function.",1
"The site is easy to navigate for leisurely reading. I still have a gripe on the writing end. Although one post clearly makes me the most money and is my top post for the past three months, it never shows up on the Friday rundown alerts. The responses I get are just ""we are aware."" Also, I wish the stats on the mobile app were broken down into stories and replies like on the website.",1
"Great app with lot of information and great content, my only question is why is the subscription fee too high, or why is there any fee at all. I am not against paid apps but this app is just like Facebook or Wikipedia, they dont write the content, its posted by users they why charge money. If you have dedicated writers like a regular news magazine then its justified",1
"The app is nice, but lately, I've been having issues with the deeplinking implementation. It opens all medium links, even the ones not supported by the app. I always have to copy the link, and open incognito for it not to open the app. It's quite frustrating. I will have to uninstall the app. I hope it gets fixed soon",1
"I have read Medium for years both in a browser and in the app. The app was better a while back, now not so much. Oddly when as a non-member I could clap for a comment and article, now as a member the spot where I clicked to clap has gone, leavng a number of claps which when I click on it just shows me who has clapped. The font is too small and won't exoand. It's still great for content/response quality and spare, ĺuminous design, just needs more work.",1
"I love this site, it is amazing in every way from showcasing the voices of those who are rarely heard, to the presentation skills this site allows to those without much experience... My issue is for the mobile version (android- Samsung Galaxy tab A and Samsung Luna Pro) is when I am starting a new story, i write the first word, hit the space button, and the word disappears; I cannot publish a new story!",1
"I think the UI is kind of clumsy. I uninstalled it once I realized my home feed didn't show articles from people I follow. Also, on a few occasions, I clicked a ""follow"" button and it failed to work, showing that I follow on the blog's page, but not if i check my followed list. Medium has great content, but it's because of 3rd party articles. I dont hate this app, but it needs to be more thougtfully designed.",1
"It is ok but a bit too clever for is own good. It would be better if you had to ""like"" a story to get similar ones suggested to you. As it is, you read one story on cats (out of curiosity) and it starts giving you stories on cats. Read two stories on cats and that is all you get. It could be a bit more nuanced as well. I want stories on bitcoin but not a dozen ""beginners guide to blockchain"". Also, the commenting interface is dreadful and i can't seem to delete old comments.",1
"Interesting as a concept but not worth the money. I've read a few articles and I spotted quite a few grammar mistakes... this is an app that focuses on the quality of its articles, there should be someone to proofread before publishing. I think it's worth mention that I'm italian, english is my second language. For a grammar mistake to be noticed by me, it means it is a big one!",1
"I'm irritated right now. I didn't read it enough to keep the subscription. And yes, you do get a month free, but there's no way to cancel until the first monthly bill goes through",1
its reading list feature don't work. when i bookmark an article for its offline availability it did work then but after closing an app and opening it the other day you cant read it offline you have to be online again to re load tge whole content plz fix this as there seems to be a problem even images don't load when i reopen the app after some time.,1
"Excellent. It's a very good app, but it has too many limits. I mean, the articles, news, etc are just great, but you have a limit to read and you can pass it for accident and to read more you have to wait a month. I like it too much, but I just read like 3 or 4 articles, and some of them I didn't want to do it.",1
"The content is great, but I'm finding the app a little frustrating. I'd like to see the following: * Some kind of ""favourite"" or tagging mechanism over and above bookmarks so I can distinguish between ""I want to read this"" and ""I want to read again / finish later"" etc. * ""continue where I left off"" - really frustrating having to scroll through long articles to find where i was last time. * An indication on reading list of whether each item is available offline * Sort options in reading list",1
"Featured articles ruined the whole experience for me. I enjoy being notified for new articles and reading informative passages but it kinda beats the point of doing that when we can only read 3 articles/month. I'm not becoming a member and be forced to pay when the internet is full of rich content from other blogs and sources, thank you very much.",1
Good app and I would like to explore it further😁✊🏿,1
"I would like to give Medium a 5 star rating for its content, as well as it's UI/UX; however I am giving it a 3 star rating because, over time, the app only puts premium content in your newsfeed which cannot be read unless you are a premium member. In my opinion this kills the overall experience to a social media network. I completely understand the developers and writers approach to this concept, but I don't believe Medium should be a paid service for its blog like content.",1
"I open a title while getting coffee or walking in the office, read a sentence or two, have to stop and actually work. An hour or two later I open the app again, 95%of the time I cannot find the same article twice so I just try to start reading whatever (title + a few sentences again). Then I get a suggested reading that I want to read & it says I've used all my free reads. I've yet to be able to read, or continue, a single article. It's effectively generating click bait notifications.Unistalling",1
"Issues with bookmark management. Cannot efficiently manage. A simple selection by tick mark would had worked. Also, those sections lag very badly. Recommendation system is also not on point. It's turning into sort of Facebook's I feel. Locking content behind pay wall seems a bad way to justify membership subscription. Since, most content is aggregated from other websites. I have begun to use the app less day by day. Most authors duplicate content. Is there even a curation system in place?",1
"There are some features on the website and with the iPhone that are not available on this app. The only thing this app is good for is reading, but if I want to see all of my notifications, I have to open my computer. If I want to write an article, I have to open my computer. I love to write with my phone and this apps limitations are hindering. Perhaps a good run down of what iPhone and the website have to offer so this app can be somewhat comparable.",1
"i find it incredibly annoying that when I'm happily reading the amazing articles this app provides it suddenly stops showing because ""I must pay for the membership"" that if it was cheaper, like 1euro/month I would certainly pay for it, but 5?? even Spotify cost less. it's not worth paying, but Mann, such a shame, because I could easily delete Instagram and just stick to reading Medium",1
"I'm still deciding about membership. I just don't read that much here. I open Medium and it says ""3 free articles left."" I go ahead and read something moderately interesting (that I can't recall a day later, oh, well.) The next day I take another look. ""You have NO MORE FREE ARTICLES LEFT"" WHAT??? Now that makes no sense at all. It's just not well managed or well explained: either way, it certainly doesn't convince me to spend m-o-n-e-y!",1
some great article with unexpected twists thrown in there. but the amount of premium to free articles is ludicrous. at the very least can I get an extra paragraph to judge how relevant it would really be. the majority of my reason for not getting a subscription in uncertainty about whether itll be worth it or not. cant get an idea of whether the articles I want to read will be another dud or hold useful info and insights,1
"Please add a filter to remove FEATURED stories. We get the point to go premium, but scrolling 10 pages for one non featured article is too much. Keep it real. Thank you",1
Both fabulous and awful. I so nearly love this app. I have read some wonderful articles but when reading things of poignancy I have to see the highlightning of others. I cannot switch it off and it spoils moments. It turns pathos into bathos. So close to excellent. Fix it and I will be back.,1
"First time on site today, seems I am up against a paywall already after 2 articles. I not am able to evaluate how well (or how often) new pieces are written, hence the overall value of the site. Being blocked from any further reading is not helpful. I chose pieces that I already had an interested in. I do not know if this kind of writing is characteristic of the site or just of those articles of interest.",1
"Archive/remove is buggy and it's super annoying. Post that you have remove occasionaly re appear on your reading list, or may get into archived. You should implement more robust API to check latest sync condition. And implement that remove button just like on the web because it is ridiculous to remove a post you have to tap twice.",1
"An unnecessary and incompletely-featured app with quirks that don't exist in the perfectly sufficient mobile and desktop webpage. I find I can't perform certain edits (captions, images) as easily as the website and keyboard quirks and app crashes mean I will happily uninstall and keep using the website directly. A great platform but an unnecessary app.",1
"It is very convenient for me and easy to use. However, whenever I post a story, when I open it, it almost never opens from the top of my writing, it starts at the end or middle of my article and I have to scroll up to the beginning. I assume that is how others see my articles too. Visibility is poor too. Other than that I like it.",1
"I am a member and I love the app but my profile page doesn't want to open, it is only loading forever. I can't even change my profile picture! Even the categories, when i try to open one of them that i'd love to follow, it doesn't open, it only keeps loading and loading! What am i paying money for exactly!",1
It was all fine until i decided to upgrade my account. They showed an error that my debit card did not support recurring payment but still debited a month's payment. I tried again and it still came out the same way. So in all i lost 2 month's money. Please help me with the refund procedure.,1
"I used to read many Medium articles online, before downloading the app. I've found that, as a free user, I'm punished for downloading the app. Only 5 of the premium articles are readable per month, and I've found that the quality of many of these articles is poor. I do like the app and enjoy reading the articles, but will likely delete it in favour of reading those which pop up on Google from time to time, without hastle. Using an incognito browser prevents the website from hiding this content.",1
I am giving this app 3🌟 because it allows you to easily write and publish articles. But after publish 2 articles (reviews) I couldn't find them on the internet if I searched for it and I was unable to read any stories because I am not a premium member. Please fix this quickly or else I will give you a more horrible rating and unistall it.,1
"I have been reading, getting inspired and then writing on this platform. It is a source of decent information and a clean app to depend on. But because now as it is monetized and I am restricted I am loosing interest in it. Can't it be like if user wants to sell article only then will need premium access and there should not be any limit for reading. Already our generation is loosing interest in reading.",1
"There is a bug when scrolling articles up and down on my pixel 3 pnone. The top and bottom banner will appear and disappear randomlly and cause the scrolling to be really jumpy and annoying. Looks like the algorithm to detect user gesture movement had some issues to distinguish the stop of a scrolling. Anyway, it's a big issue when reading any article and it's a basic issue that an app like medium shouldn't make. Hope your Android Mobile team can fix it asap.",1
"It's great for people who want to share their words and people who like reading. However the whole membership thing makes it a little hard on the readers part to continue reading without any obstacles. But then again, it is a great thing for the writers. All over a great app.",1
Some articles are VERY good - but I feel like since they charge so much they feel the need to have quantity not all quality. I read an article today for sleep that had a piece of advice that professionals have warned me against (vegging out in front of a tv before bed... That's compulsive compulsory behavior and it's not helpful at all) I wish they had a better vetting process. But I guess that's the world we live in 🤷🏻‍♀️,1
"Most of the quality content is behind a paywall. Once you've read your free ""member"" articles for the week, you're stuck with a small amount of low-quality content. The membership price is more than I can justify for a variable-quality blog feed.",1
"This is the only magazine app I would subscribe to (especially since I'm such a huge Wisecrack fan), but there's one glaring flaw. I am not in the least interested in Apple products, I did not list Apple as any of my interests, yet almost every single day I get another notification for my daily read and guess what... APPLE! They're ALL about Apple! I haven't seen one single notification about Android or Google that's noteworthy. Are there just too many Apple fanboys here?",1
great app i must say. I recommended this platform to approx 10-15 folks so far. I have been using this for about two years now. I opened the app after almost 3 months today and Boom hardly any free article to read. Left with few bookmarks in hand. You guys charge $50 subscription fee for a year which converts to 3500INR approx. With 2700INR appox I could buy Amazon prime and kindle unlimited both for a year. Definitely content is good but pricing should be based on country you offer to.,1
Interesting aproach but I wished there was a article rate system besides claps. Some way to mark low quality content. There are a bunch of articles that are plain stupid or click bait. Unfurtunately there is not much feedback you can offer besides commenting which would probably make it even more popular.,1
I appreciate good writing and I know there is a lot of excellent content on Medium. I also approve of their business model of providing some free content and putting other content behind a paywall in order to pay writers. And I AM considering becoming a paying member. However - apparently you only get 1 free paywalled article per month as a none member. And EVERYTHING this app recommends for me to read is paywalled - at least as far as I can tell by clicking one article after another and getting told I have to pay to read it. If the point is to provide some free reading to encourage people to pay to support good writing the experience needs to be much less frustrating. Make sure some free content appears in the feed and label articles as free or paid so potential readers don't have the endless frustration of clicking and being turned away. I'm sure many folks just delete the app after a few fruitless clicks. Other than that the app works fine. Just extremely frustrating.,1
"I love the idea of Medium, but as a writer and frequent contributor to it I would like to see the android version of the app to have the same amount of features as the iOS versions. It puts writers at a disadvantage if you are using the app to present some sense of professionalism. Please even up the playing field...",1
"You are to find out, what this app is really about, ""subscription."" Before spending internet data by downloading this, please be aware that you will be entitled to pay monthly subscription, after you have read 3-4 articles within the article selection.",1
"Great app to make articles and share information, however the fact that a lot of those articles are locked behind a paywall means that you often end up scrolling through the platform with 65% of anything that catches your eye being limited to a paragraph of reading at most unless you buy a membership.",1
"This is a very good app. One issue I have is after every few updates the link from Google home to medium app gets into an infinite loop. So when I click a topic from Google home that is forwarded to the app, the app opens the browser which opens the app which opens the browser... Very annoying.",1
"Neat UI, great articles. There is one problem with app thought, toolbar twiches every time I scroll an article down, which is distracting. Is it really that hard to hide toolbar smoothly? It is not a phone issue, on my second phone the app behaves likewise.",1
Onyx boox max 3. Scrolling is real pain in the app. Why there is no controls to change pages fast like page up/down?! When I try to use browser for reading (because it has such controls) I cannot sign in: after I choose my android account it seems trying to login but after short time bounces back. Very disappointed with such stupid issues in basic functionality.,1
"Good content but very disappointing. I understand that you want users to subscribe for illimited content, but now even my daily read (when the notification pops) is hidden and requires me to pay to read it. What's the point of pushing a notification to me only to prevent me from reading it? I would suggest to require a subscription if I want to browse and read more article, but not for the daily read. Thanks!",1
"Last time I checked editing and publishing articles from my phone is missing a lot of options, and is not user frendly at all. If I'm unable to get to pc, I can't properly publish an article. Otherwise, very useful app for reading.",1
Limited features compared to the web app,1
"Great articles but unless you are a member, there is a limit to how many you can read per month. So... best to not download and view through browser where access is unlimited. I will be deleting the app.",1
"The platform is good overall, I really learn a lot from Medium. However, I face bugs when scrolling at the articles at the app. It frustrates me. I hope that can be fixed soon so that I can have a better reading experience",1
"The homepage curates articles that can be more than 5 years old. I can't figure out how to make it show only more recent and relevant articles. It's like I'm constantly seeing only the ""best of"" articles instead of writing that'll keep me coming back for more.",1
"The Android app is just so much more limited than the experience on a PC. For a platform dedicated to providing top tier writing, it is woefully inadequate & in need of a massive upgrade. I for one would pay higher membership fees gladly if the app was even close to the PC experience.",1
"As a reading app, it's good. I still feel the app lacks features for a writer/publisher.",1
It's really a remarkable app that i have ever used prior I'm giving 3-star bcoz some of the article not allowed me to read . Basically it's fair to not allow all the articles read for everyone bcoz i was trying to use it without any fee . But there is one request that if anything that are free then plzzzzzzz send them to me or mail only those articles which are of cost.,1
Did not make a good impression. the dark UI was nice. navigation was crisp. it just seemed like most of the articles I found were negative and more like complaining rather than talking about anything factual? I'll give it another try at a later date.,1
"Great concept and website, but the mobile app is lacking on the Pixel 3XL. The app does not handle the notch well, and is 'jerky' when scrolling through articles. This may just be an issue on the Pixel 3XL, but is nonetheless frustrating.",1
"Overall, a good experience but the screen flickering (due to toolbars being hidden when scrolling direction changes) is annoying. It appears to have some UI glitches on Samsung Galaxy S10, as the top toolbar is sometimes only half visible. Monospaced typefaces are too thin and barely legible.",1
"I guess if you know a ton of writers who write for this medium, you know exactly what you would be buying into by subscribing. I do know a few, but not enough to subscribe to a membership after being able to read only two pieces. It will be a great idea if you if you extended a one-day trial or special. I didn't even bother to check out how much it would cost, because I'm on a tight budget right now. if I spend money I have to know that it's worth it, and I can't tell after reading to articles.",1
"It's a good platform, but my app often suddenly close and not responding. I also can't open my profile.",1
The quality of the app is great. However can't you provide a free model with ads and/or access to 10 articles for free members. Almost every article I click on requires an upgrade. Atleast a good try before you buy option would be wonderful.,1
"App is ok. Unfortunately, great content lets the app team or VP responsible for the app to get away with a mediocre app. Either fund the team building it so they can build something awesome or get rid of the leadership that is preventing the dev team from making something awesome. There is no need for a substandard app in 2019. I need a better way to organize your content for reuse and search. I look at your content like I an addon to my brain so that I don't have to commit to my brain.",1
"Love the app, its simple but effective UI with zero distraction. Just tapping the article for preview burns your three free articles per month. I understand tagging the free articles separately will impact your subscriptions but it will be really helpful",1
The writing is devolving into opinion pieces from it's original creative concept.,1
"The app behaves weird. I can use it with no problem when directly open the app. However, if I open medium through supported links, the app keeps on flicker for around 30 seconds. Afterwards, it returns to the landing page of the app Now I cannot open and medium link.",1
"Nice app.the inky issue i have with it right now is the navigation, it had no directives for a beginner or a new user, but it has cool contents. Would give it a 4 but I'm really not okay with the navigation. it's a little complex.",1
"Very nice app but while reading the bookmarked content, it keep scrolling to bottom on its own. Don't know why but it is actually very irritating. Hope this doesn't happen in browser. I will remove app and read the content in browser.",1
"The inescapable ""editors picks"" and the ""articles based on your reading history"" really ruin what should be a great app. Worse than useless, they clog up the main news feed. The ability to remove such stuff would hugely improve things.",1
Medium is a good platform for reading articles across various subject. One major drawback is you can't view the history of the articles read. The only negative about Medium. Developers for heaven's sake add this feature.,1
Feature Request: the annoying to me is what I'm reading and got interruption then I switched to do other things and go back to the reading page and it lost or accidentially close the page I clicked from socials It's show me home page and I can't go to my recent page.,1
I like the app but I can't highlight articles in app anymore. Would love to be able to highlight.,1
"The app has very good UI, and good flow. It's very convenient to read in the app. But I DO NOT want to pay such an exorbitant amount to be able to read through the app, which I can actually read for free on the web page.",1
"Was great but recently lost the text capture feature for social media sharing where it would turn highlights into images to post to Twitter. The feature disappeared from the whole platform, as far as I can tell, and it makes sharing & promoting stories more difficult.",1
"Every time I open a link with this app, (after the app launches) it auto opens Chrome to a webpage of the article. This is super annoying because if you set your links to auto open to this app, it creates a loop of trying to open Chrome and Medium and you can't get to the article.",1
I can't archive article by double click on a bookmark icon anymore. And I cannot find how and where I can archive articles now. I also cannot categorize my bookmark. It's hard to search for specific article I want to read at the moment.,1
I was using an Apple phone prior and I loved the app through the app store. I recently shifted to an Android and I'm not able to write series and do many functions that I could do through ios. I think this is very unfair and hope that you add these features soon.,1
"Very less free articles, even though the range of articles is immense and the quality is amazing. Very different. Would appreciate if there were more than just 3 or 4 free articles per day.",1
Comment section in this app is really bad. You have to make so many extra taps to follow the conversation in comment section.,1
"Good, BUT... the app does not sync up with my favorite/reading list selections when I click on web browser on PC. I paid $50 for a yr sub. This needs to be fixed. Then I will give it five stars Are you listening devs?",1
unable to add code in regular sentence as in Google Chrome. In Google Chrome i can do that by `adding code in this section`. It would be great if developers provide any syntax or any option on selecting text to quote code in between sentence.,1
"It's probably because I don't understand the app, but although I'm a paid-up subscriber to Medium, the installation on my tablet doesn't recognise that and there seems no way to remedy that, but the installation on the Chromebook does. Any help?",1
"I bought the subscription to read a story and the story was only 2 lines longer than the free intro. Not to say that medium was saying it's 4 minutes read for a 30 second article. Future user, you will be paying but the content will not be curated or verified. Why paying?",1
"First, I ❤ Medium. However, I feel the content value has declined since gaining more popularity. It seemed a place for academics and tech professionals, people with credentials, to personally publish their new ideas and recent developments. Now, it's just a blog... less qualified people blogging their opinions. Oversaturated with dating/relationship ""advice"" and sociopolitical click bait. Change your preferences often for new things, to keep those types of article from being seen as often.",1
"it's pretty good app but I can't remove/reduce upvotes for upvotes if given mistakenly. Or atleast no intuitive way. [EDIT] : I have found help in medium FAQs. However the way is still not intuitive/easy. Please do ""claps"" SEO with term ""upvotes"" as well, because for Google, medium upvotes means nothing.",1
"The search options are poor, no sorting, no language selection etc.",1
"I enjoy the content, I'm frustrated with the paid portion. I like free information flow. If I use it for my writing, I never want anyone to think about the cost of my data or how much they need to pay for knowledge.",1
"5 star platform, -2 stars for the pay wall. Sorry got too used to freemium model with ads.",1
"I thought it was free to get reading, but it's too costly 330rs/month. But Medium is good to read.",1
The app was great when the articles were free. The content provided is not worth the subscription price. The estimated reading time is a useful feature.,1
good. Sound. Does not constantly bug me with emails. Just does its job.,1
"Great app,you can learn a lot and find yourself in some interesting stories...but in my opinion I'm not so satisfied because you had to pay for more then 5 stories.",1
"The app is great, but to send me notification to read something and when I open the app to read it, it tells me you've to pay to read that!! so why sending it in the first place",1
"When I reach the bottom of an article, it randomly scrolls up for some reason. Uninstalling, but very sleek design. I respect the company a lot for what they're innovating.",1
"excelent articles but they need to provide an option/setting to not-show-highlights-by-others, it is very irritating. I was a paid subscriber, but canceled my subscription until they fix this problem.",1
"Thoughtful articles! However, only 3 per month in the free version feels kinda stingy when most articles are about being better. Wouldn't a helpful app like this want you to engage every day, not just monthly?",1
Medium was pretty good until they added member preview and all these other monetization features. I shouldn't have to pay to access content which most of the authors are perfectly fine to publish for free.,1
"If you find an article on Google in Chrome, it will aren't too open in medium. After opening in medium, it tries to open back in chrome. This results in a race condition.",1
"the gist github could be better. it's like 50% overlayed by white color. not really readable. or add syntax highlighting out of the box, that's the reason people embed gist. the web version is fine",1
"This app is what it is. It's Buzzfeed but with better writing. I was expecting insightful and thought provoking articles, I was disappointed but I can imagine there is still a big audience for it. It's just not for me.",1
"Medium has a lot of great content that would be tremendously better with editorial oversight. I pay $4/mo for the New York Times, which has proofreaders. I am reluctant to pay for content that hasn't been proofread by editors with strong English skills.",1
The new Swipe-to-Save/See Less is cool and all but it's hard to execute the action. The card-object doesn't seem to stick with my finger so it's like me trying to push a car with one finger. Please fix.,1
"you have to pay!!l I was loving it, til my trail memberzhip ended, boo!!! There where alot of great titles of topics ,in all areas of life. Wish I could of read that last article, but the app had alot great news lines! Really",1
"UI is very clean. Would be a great app if Medium didn't flood me with the most basic, vapid ""articles"" imaginable, despite me indicating that I'm not interested in it every time it comes up.",1
"Wish there were more publishing functions: only one tag is allowed. Also, can't select if eligible for payment or not. Other than that, I like it.",1
The app and content is good. Issue is that I can read only one article peacefully if logged in. I can read it if I log out because then no one is counting. Then why bither making an account.,1
"The app itself is quite clean and works well. But the widget only shows ""problem loading widget"" and the swipe actions for see fewer and save are quite buggy and almost never works intuitively.",1
"Difficult to hide stories, usually opens the story instead, costing one of your free reads. I'd suggest not trying to hide stories but if you don't the algorithm fills your feed with junk. Catch-22",1
"Reading articles on the app is okay. However, writing articles on it has limited functions. I have to do the editing on a computer again to get the right format",1
"descent app, most stories are good but not great. from title it feels like a good story but when i start reading i realize there is nothing here. may be its just me but i have noticed this multiple times. i read mostly tech (programming) stuff.",1
"i love reading articles but this whole 3 stories a month doesn't work in the sense, i haven't even used the app recently and the first star post i try to read says I'm at my limit and yet i haven't read any articles in that month. can yall fix this?",1
"Can't get in the app, I'm trying to login multiple ways but non of them seem to work.. I tried connecting to google directly through the beginning too and it doesn't work. May redownload it..",1
I used to get 3 articles free every month. I don't know why i am not seeing my free reads anymore? Is there a bug in the app or this feature has been removed? I am facing this from previous 3 app updates,1
"Good, but limitations do exist such as no highlight text for copy and paste. I think the pay wall is not a good idea for generating revenue.",1
"I've read articles that are very good, great and one or three, just pure knowledge. Was able to conclude a problem of many months after reading an article. I'd give it a 4 if it can solve cancer :)",1
"Looks good, and easy to use. However, glitches sometimes happen with series stories. And sometimes the featured story is incorrect.",1
I am using the free version but I think I need to upgrade because the articles and pieces are just too good to not read. Thank you Medium!,1
You can only read limited articles as a free member. Which is used up when you click through from links. I use to publish on medium but now use other avenues due to this restriction as my link readers will encounter the same penalties.,1
"Good app, good sources, but there are plenty of good news aggregators out there that don't cut you off from reading entire free stories and demand payment.",1
"Mostly adequate. You can't send private notes, and publishing through the app is clumsy. It's difficult to get the hashtags to work. It's easier to use the app to read.",1
Great platform with unsatisfactory mobile content. It doesn't make sense to have an app with very little free content listed as free app. this is a sure recipie for low rating.,1
Cozy so far 😊. Only that members get to experience the thrill of reading in and out.,1
it is a great platform to get in touch with people all around the globe. I love the font provided by the company. it was such a smooth experience to type something on it.,1
"Feed has to improve, i see almost same articles. However, on trying to go through profile, the content seems more promising...seems feed has to be improved...",1
The app is fine. Content gets old and somewhat repetitive. There's enough free blogging and writing available that it's not necessary.,1
"I love everything about medium. The only issue is the paid articles. You don't get any paid member articles per month because it told me I reached my maximum and I haven't read any yet. The problem is, because I can appreciate its only $5 a month and I can appreciate that it pays per clap but what I can't appreciate is the only thing that's recommended to me via email is paid member content that I can't read.. So it's like every week I get a big, look at what you can't read this week email.",1
"Everybody gotta eat, but since the pay wall came, it got confusing and hard to navigate content. Should be redesigned if they want to keep it",1
"When I scroll forward, the top and bottom bars disappear. When I scroll back, they reappear and the top one covers the content I was scrolling back for. I'd like to turn off this feature.",1
"Pretty good experience. There's a 'bug' or maybe just minor neglected point, when opening medium links though Google now the app opens and then immediately throws me back to the browser, opening the article there.",1
Very interested articles about everything from people's lives to the coronavirus and more. I just can't stop reading the stories. The only problem is if you do not pay the monthly fee your limited on how many articles you can read weekly.,1
"Works very well. A wide range of stories to read from, you can also write if you wish. Don't like that I have to pay for other stories though",1
"Too expensive! At that 5.99 price range it competes with subscriptions of services like Spotify, Avast even Netflix.... I'd consider it at 1.99 or a single payment of 19.99",1
Great content and simple UI worth subscribing. But need more improvement there is no way to reset/check your reading history and please add feature to give category when saving article.,1
Complained but didnt get any feedback. Why does the app close everytime i try to view profiles or edit my own profile?,1
"This was my first time writing a post through the mobile app and I realized that unlike on the website, the mobile app doesnt have any indication of how to upload images on the stories or how to add a title to the story",1
Solid reading experience. Lots of material available. Very little can be read without paying a monthly fee though.,1
It would be great if you can add history of what I read. Sometimes I accidentally close the app and it's very difficult to find that article again.,1
"It's a really good app for reading articles and blogs related to a certain profession or topic or subject,but then it says you have to get premium membership to read further articles",1
"Wouldve been 5 stars until i hit my ""monthly limit"" the day i downloaded the app. Maybe communicate that it isnt free before users hit a limit they didnt know they had?",1
"So I downloaded the app to have easy access to the articles, yet there are articles I can only read using the browser...... it doesn't really make any sense.",1
"I just don't like the limited amount of stories for the free membership. But yes, I get that weiters have to live. Otherwise, great app !",1
What went wrong Medium?! My feed it always filled with premium articles. I understand that you guys want more memberships but not everyone has to be a member. I get to read every one article out of 15 scrolled.,1
This app starts out good enough but starts to create problems when I try to embed YouTube video or tweets (it doesn't work) and I can't find any options to publish to Medium publications.,1
"After turning off topics I used to follow, I keep getting recommended articles about those topics. It's really annoying as I have no interest in them. The service would be perfect if it wasn't for that.",1
I enjoy the medium platform reading great articles. The latest update makes unpleasant experience on my Samsung s7. It jumps further down while still reading even after scrolling up it would do it again.,1
too expensive price for a monthly,1
"Love the parts of the app that match the web implementation. That said, the lack of publication tools in the app is a major ding.",1
I would rather Google and read the article nowadays. Every second article says Upgrade for next chapter. Which was not there before. Medium rather make it a paid app initially only.,1
"The app is great, with an interesting interface, browsing through it has become an everyday hobby. Thanks to the developers, you're awesome",1
"I think the app is worth 5 stars, but having to pay for the service after clicking on a few site links I didn't even know were medium articles is worse then click bait...",1
What's this monthly limited access constraint while viewing the articles? It was not there before. I am sure it has laid my attention away from the app.,1
Only 5 articles monthly is far too less. Otherwise very good content.,1
It's almost perfect! Friendly user interface and bugs-free. The only flaw though is the monetization. Please expand the countries available for monetization. I'm from Philippines by the way.,1
"Honestly it's a great app, but I don't like the fact that without becoming a member you can only read a certain amount of articles a month.",1
im enjoy reading. the only problem is it limit the reading per month. of course i pay but this make it's harder to share an interesting article to others.,1
My only problem is that I have to use Medium with VPN connection ... I don't know why it doesn't work normally But this happens on the website too,1
"recently the toolbar opens and closes semi randomly while scrolling both on my phone and my tablet (Samsung tab s3), this is very distracting.",1
For some reason i can't listen to audio stories. They open but are just stuck and wont play. I paid for membership.,1
I like this app a lot! It is easy to access and provides great stories. But I'd love the font size to be reduced.,1
opened an article and saw a message that I need to upgrade yo premium to see more than 3 lines.... so 2005. uninstalled!!!,1
They should offer subscription option based on geographic location. 5$ have different value in USA 🇺🇸 and much different value in Malawi 🇲🇼. I would have bought its subscription had it been lower.,1
I'd give it a 5 star but there's a technical issue. Clap button isn't working on my S10 device. Wanted to bring it to notice of devs. Will rate it once devs respond to it,1
There is a weird scrolling issue in dark mode(Android pie). While scrolling down and staying at some place it will automatically scroll up to some section.,1
I use it to see articles written by a friend,1
"It's amazing! what l have seen on this app, but the sad part is it has only three free articles per month.lt would be great if you could make it one/day.",1
"was happy early on, when the app wasnt littered with paid content 90% of the time. ive no problem in paying, except it shouldnt havw been fr and the first time",1
"I enjoy reading current ideas, interesting new technology and most of all laughing along with the funny stories.",1
"wonderful, until I was told to upgrade. I use to think Medium was free until this morning.",1
"In my galaxy s9 plus there is no padding on both left and right side, which makes the text quite cramped on my edge displays.",1
"It's great. But to continue reading you have to pay. I really enjoyed it but unfortunately i don't have the money to pay for reading articles. But if you have money, just go for it.",1
"would love to have an option to save articles in favorites structure, not just read later / archive, for easy access later",1
The only reason I rated this 3 is because it's difficult for me to navigate the site on a smartphone. It has nothing to do with the content on Medium!,1
Consistently engaging curation of stories.Very easy app to use but as I read found I was on trial subscription which just ended.,1
The app limits the articles I save in Evernote (as a paying member) to the first paragraph only.,1
"Liked it when it worked. Recently it just causes my phone to go haywire, blinking black and white screen",1
I only got this app because the website is so annoying and badly coded. I wish I could subscribe to tags instead of huge generalized topics as I only read a niche portion of the articles,1
"Search results are limited, it does not load more articles when I scroll down to the bottom.",1
It's a great app...I love that it has a variety of topics u can choose and read from.. Almost like pintrest...,1
Good content but a stupid algorithm used to suggest new articles and a very basic app makes it hard to find.,1
It is a good app to learn basic concepts and advance consept in programming but you have to pay for it's service.,1
The night and light mode keep blending. Hopefully this can be fixed in a later update,1
Very good app. Very little free posts until limit. Unfortunately switching to ingognito seems one way street to me,1
The new update when I scroll up it takes me back to the middle of the article. This sucks a lot when I try to go up.,1
Everything is good in this app except the restriction of articles.Education should be free if not at least it's affordable .,1
Interesting articles but constant nagging to upgrade. I'm going to uninstall it right now.,1
"The experience with this app is fun, but I don't like that I have to pay for this app. And my links to my stories aren't working. Can you please make this app free and fix it?!i",1
"Recently when i read articles it redirect automatically into home page for some reason, didn't touch anything tough,",1
It's so bad when you are reading but some images are still downloading an then when the download finish the screen scroll and you lose the focus,1
It is good but most articles need paid subscription. Not suitable for me.,1
Its good but membership amount per month is too cost....sharing knowledge is a precious one...so concession can be give to frequent users,1
I love Medium but sometimes the app crashed when I just looking around at homepage or click some article it just annoying me.,1
"informative and knowledgeable about the material for readership, keep up good app, appreciate!!!",1
"Very clear and precise. However, is there a way to read a previous article. A history of what I have read before does not exist.",1
Wish i had more reads but love the concept and the quality of the material delivered right to me!,1
"i like the app very helpful but the month reading limitation is not good sonce we consider Medium as educational site, i think donate will be better",1
"I love Medium, but am frustrated that it never seems to recognize my paid subscription whether I'm signed in or not.",1
"This platform is so good to we got and read the article, but knowledge actually must to be free for public, medium doesn't to make the reader paid for read",1
"This is the second day I am using your app.1st day I rated 5 stars. Now I changed to 3 stars.Follwing are the reasons Its good to have Medium, but in countries where the cost of living is less and earning is accordingly to. You can't expect high price for your subscription to read articles.",1
Keyboard pop-up not working. I can't type until when i minimize and open the app back till the keyboard pops-up,1
your recent algorithmic change to show me my personalized feed is bad. just one look at an article then my feed is entirely filled with them :(,1
"When I write sth on Medium & send its link to someone, then it shows error with regard to 404 or sth. Please fix it.",1
the articles are interesting and good conversation starters.,1
i think its agood app but it must not be payed. but i think if it also provide direct videos then it could be more better.,1
The app need improvements in the UI. Words do not fits containers; header shakes; screens looks cluttered.,1
"Hope for Chinese support. Currently Chinese characters have strange line height, and sometimes the title would be cutted-off",1
slow to open from an external link. The splash screen shows for a long time,1
Reading Medium articles in a web browser is more satisfying in some ways than reading in the Medium app.,1
I'm not sure how to turn it off. a simple fix is required for me to thoroughly enjoy it. As much as i like the app; I have to be able to turn it off when I want to. thanks,1
"Medium is okay. I'd like the option of being able to edit all my stories, posts. As it stands, only those that are public am I able to edit.",1
Great articles. but after some times everything is for members.,1
"some interesting reads, some clickbait. ok interface. room for improvement.",1
Good articals on business,1
Interesting app would be better if i could see the full list of topics and wasnt half way cut off on my phone...,1
Very Limited Free Functionality. Only five articles a month.,1
Medium has very interesting news and articles but is not so good being able to read 2 articles per month if you don't subscribe.,1
Has some good stuff. Recommendations need some work. Half the articles seem to have been written by gender study graduates.,1
Great writers. Would like to filter on latest article? Not intuitive,1
"Disappointed that you cant do much with the free version of Medium...so far, app works fine.",1
Doesn't log in since their logins are email link only. What a bad limitation.,1
"I am from india , can't access to partner program here two reasons 1. SRIPE is not available in india 2. I don't have Pc and can't enroll for partner program through my smartphone.",1
"really good app, but it seems that only pay contents are shown on my main list of articles.",1
I did find it had some interesting content but the pay wall seems a little steep.,1
The Experience has been a wonderful one for me,1
At first I thought this was also like Pinterest but this is different this is up to date unlike Pinterest I really like the application,1
"The news can't be read without paying, the conversation section is annoying",1
"I just reduced two stars coz everything I touch is premium material, its nt accomadating gd enough fr users expecting to read free articles",1
Sooooooo many premium stories!!! :( It was better before,1
Nice content but it's only a lead in for you to buy the membership.,1
"Not able to view article from chrome, always redirects me back to chrome.",1
"I love this app, but on xiaomi device the highlight option doesn't show up. please fix this.",1
"The only downside is the limited monthly reads , i uninstalled it for that.",1
"your recommender system is very bad, most of my homepage posts are for premium members only and on the same topic , i am starting to get bored from that application after it was my best app",1
I love the stories. More realistic and relatable,1
I like the articles published on Medium but would love to read more at no cost.,1
"Make it Native, the bad connection page of a broken link is just... can't even put it into words",1
"Nice app, but utterly useless without a paid subscription.",1
"My experience has been fair. Although finding a specific subject on the site is difficult, much of the writing is insightful. So, a little better than 'meh'.",1
Premium subscription is too costly. You should reduce to get more subscribers.,1
The app gets hang frequently and black screen appears multiple times.,1
Like contributing to authors. Wish landscape orientation worked better.,1
"Ever since they introduced the payment model, the qualoty of the content is reduced.",1
Interesting articles. Annoying when limits kick in. Too expensive to subscribe,1
I feel like the suggested content kind of traps readers in a bubble rather than exposing them to new things.,1
Really good... expert in a particular field written own thought in the form of blog..you won't get a precious idea any other platforms,1
this app would be great if it offered the same interaction and commenting opportunities that the website offers.,1
Not getting much value from it if you don't pay... only limited contents for free users.,1
Access to interesting thoughts - if you can afford it,1
"Too biased for me personally. UI seems nice though, if you can get passed the bias, it's probably okay.",1
Great Content behind a paywall. Wont give it one star because its actually good reading.,1
"Night mode color is awful, contrast is too high, give me real night mode not #000000",1
I enjoy writing on medium.. I have a lot of readers but i can't earn using stripe because it's not in my country.. I wish Medium endorsed a global payments system like PayPal or make stripe global. I mean no single African country is listed.. Ain't that discrimination?,1
It will be better with Vietnamese language support for Vietnamese writers and users. Hope it will happen or I can not use Medium for my long-term plan.,1
There should be more free content for people to read without upgrading.,1
Infinite open loop when app opened via hyperlink. They should fix this issue as they are forcing users to open via app when using browser,1
This is a good app. But selling people hard work for a price is too much for me.,1
"I do enjoy medium, I truly do. I'm in a very expensive UX bootcamp though... I would love to see some kind of student pass. I get great ux articles daily but can't justify the cost for a premium account.",1
Stories are human interest. Beautiful enough to solve ones problems if properly applied,1
"Still need much more improvements about the Apps, I found it so low in response.",1
Content is great but Medium website has a much better layout than the app.,1
Everything is good but that premium thing literally bothered me. Shhhhh! I want this app but i can't get premium. shooott. Do something about it.,1
"Good for now, haven't used it much, will improve the rating later on as long as the experience is good🤞🏻",1
"When I tap on Clap button, it doesn't do anything.",1
Just few free articles per month.. That sucks..reason why I many times even don't open this app..,1
new to this app but enjoyed reading the content whatever little i had the time to looking forward to more such enriching content,1
Not able to pay for subscription...It shows bank not available...,1
Reading data on wide big screen such as dekstop is better while reading in small screen like mobile apps,1
"Although medium is fantastic, the Android app doesn't work well.",1
Charging money just to read few articles is not good. Switching to other app.,1
"Full of premium stories that just exist to eat up your ""freemium"" reads. Lots of derivative posts. You might find your stories rewritten enough to not be plagiarism without credits to your original story. I blame the crypto community on here thats trying to make a quick buck online. You'd be better off submitting stories to newspapers as the staff wont be to helpful in getting you credited in others stories. They(mods) are nice enough to allow contrasting views from different political camps",1
Medium is good but having limited number of articles can be read for free account....i am not agree with it 😑,1
"Okay APP, except for the HIGH ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION! 2020 begins my tyrant against all nonsensical subscription GOOGLE PLAY STORE DEVELOPERS! (NTS - Pro version, Subscription, Family Library).",1
After latest update sometimes the app will stuck loading article from links from Twitter app,1
Limit on reading posts doesn't seem to renew properly,1
Good app but lately not able to open links into the app.,1
Why can't I delete my old posts? This sucks and Please give a reminder of how many free medium articles I can read? Please enable me to delete my posts or enlighten me how to do it? As this app is less user friendly than others,1
In this updated version scrollbar not showing after open the article .,1
"Ok, not bad up to point, but misleading because it REQUIRES payment.",1
Very good app just you need to upgrade for reading more articles...,1
the app is fine. Medium's paywall is annoying.,1
This is not free app because every article need upgrade ( membership ),1
This is good things which provides very good knowledge concisely and summarised in the required topics,1
the content is good but there's absolutely no way I'm making to now start paying for this it's not that good,1
App needs a lot of improvements specially in editing!,1
Issue still persists..it crashes when going through articles,1
"I like this type of journalism and get into people's views on life, etc. But opinions and topics are biased towards US, and I often find it hard to related to what's presented to me.",1
"There has to be basic free option, though!",1
why charges...? charges are not affordable too. otherwise app is wonderful,1
Font is bit uncomfortable you should change the font.,1
"Interesting, well informed and entertaining but too tied to USA issues.",1
The clap feature have bug in app . I can give as many claps without limit,1
I think it's a good app which gives writers a platform to share their thoughts to the world.,1
"Subscription required after a trial period, otherwise two more stars,",1
"What's not to like...well, I just signed up and used up free read In no time.",1
Opening medium link is not opening medium app instead it opens chrome,1
Story on Medium is quality but I can't read more 2 story per month if I don't paid. I don't enough money to paid,1
No undo functionality makes the editor a very poor way to write stories.,1
Good work and i really like to read using medium 🙃,1
"They pressed me for a rating, so rating 3 that the app seems to do its job. Nothing more, nothing less.",1
"why is the limitation for user to read only specific number of articles, what if i have juat opened them to add in my queue.",1
For the app sake it would be better if some free articles are provided...,1
good app for universal information,1
medium delivers great scientific articles while also supported by a mobile app,1
Really good but the membership taxes is much higher,1
It is very informative... But if you can lower the price,1
images improperly resize when shifting between screen angles.,1
"Interesting articles. Disadvantage, is not free",1
It's sleek and enjoyable Article reading just got easier,1
Nice app for publishing articles across multidisciplinary spheres.,1
A paywall to access user contributed articles? pass.,1
Issue with bookmark article not saving on device.,1
"Good, but non member limitation is too much...😕",1
The app really needs improvement... The iOS version is far better (and prettier).,1
Unfortunately this needs to paid to read good Articles. But articles are good,1
It is informative but if it is fully free then everyone take benefits from it.,1
"Great reading tool, but wow do they aggressively paywall.",1
i am being spammed with articles i cannot read as a regular user. please don't send them as an advertisment. i will not upgrade to premium.,1
2 stars removed for not having an option to bypass rating this.,1
Image loading issues while reading articles.,1
App is Great but subscription is too expensive...,1
"Whatever I wanna read, asks me to upgrade to be able to continue reading😞",1
eclectic articles about tech and relationships ...short articles,1
Not as updated with news enough for me. The articles I have read were awesome though.,1
Very good material.,1
Trial basis should have more options rather tha. Just keeping users astray with limited viewing,1
There are so much helpful informations.Kind of useful app.,1
"people have a lot of feelings on the site and in what they publish, but there is some good stuff and a wide variety.",1
Useful but needs subscription for more,1
Uninstalled due to reaching my quota of allotted free articles. Good luck monetizing other people's content!,1
more interesting articles than expected. thinking of membership,1
"Im having a hard time navigating and would like to comment on some of the articles, i cant figure it out. Also curious about how i could write a story.",1
The content is not free of cost..,1
it's better if we get free articles.. there are some free apps there..then why ee choose this.. waste of time to install this apl,1
request to upgrade and not allow to read,1
I am from Nepal. I also want to earn from Medium but it's not allowed for nepalese people. I hope to hear soon that Nepalese would also get chance to earn from medium.,1
The loading time was extremely long,1
ANDROID APP DOESN'T SHOW ALL STORY DRAFTS....PLEASE FIX.,1
"Great informative stories,, but not free to read..",1
Need to Add More Content. But Yes I Did Love the App Informative Content .,1
The best collective of the best articles... You have to pay for reading X articles.,1
"I love the content that is carefully written, but there are a lot of poorly researched opinion pieces and anti-topic articles that really do bloogging, journalism and all of us more harm than good. Free speech implies responsibility of integrity and that can be lacking here if you don't choose carefully.",1
There is an error in the Profile page!,1
We can't afford upgrade so its almost useless app but Love the content,1
its very good the content is very elobrate makes me bored while reading,1
seems better than Quora so far but im annoyed it didnt let me make an account using my protonmail address,1
"Readability is much better in Web, it only promotes paid articles.",1
The scrolling is very buggy,1
Great app but it costs money that I don't have for apps. Bye.,1
Might as well make it a paid app free version is useless too less stories for you to read per month,1
Is very limited for free users and is not really enjoyable,1
Make the content free or at least lower the prices.,1
Knowledge sharing platforms must be cost free for better connections.,1
"I love medium on other platforms, but this app doesn't do the service justice.",1
I know that publishers are hiring for money but is there no way to provide this to us without a pay wall?,1
Medium brings ideas as well as people closer than anything experienced.,1
"the app seems to be a nice enough app, but the interests represented thereby are so moronically progressive it's like a punch in the face every time I see my news feed - your religion is clearly too ingrained to be unlearned, and I value my peace too much, so buh-bye ..",1
You can do better on the payment plans... Stop charging everything,1
It was quite informative and fun.... Learning new things everyday.,1
good app but too costly to read articles,1
Reader engagement should be considered for improvement,1
It's ok good legible text and fast to open,1
There are so many articles recommended based on your reading history that you don't ever get the chance to actually read articles that they can use to predict what articles you'd want want to read based on your reading history....,1
"Informative, insightful, inspiring and helpful",1
more than half of the articles are paid .....you can only read the headlines,1
"Why too expensive for upgrade? :( But I still like this app, thank you ✨",1
Very slow. Poor UID,1
"Too many reads on money and success.Not enough on just being a human being. And not enough on bridging through the many layers that keep us isolated. The beauty in our differences yet how we can meet up, listen, break bread, create together, a world that sees the unique yet the spirit and oneness that we are. How can we create a new world every moment that is based on openness, acceptance appreciation and mutual respect?.",1
Very informative and easy to understand the concept.,1
It has an interesting interface. Great app.,1
Good and Read Lot of Informative,1
Whatever happened to the swipe function to save or dismiss?,1
No way to filter out paid content,1
The articles are worthy. But we the free readers face the the danger of upgradation.,1
auto hide nav bars while browsing is buggy,1
Cause they are charging fee on-the other hand Wikipedia is open source with no fee and relies on donation.,1
What is the icon? A dice?,1
Don't know how to add a title or an image link..,1
scrolling is not as effective as on the web. (Xiaomi A2 Lite),1
I want to know why it's difficult to comment on articles. simple stuff.,1
ok app but why does it always clear the article i had open and was planning to read later ?,1
Provides great read across all fields,1
"It's not been more informative lately, but better than nothing I guess",1
Premium on medium charges are very expensive,1
Too many recommended items are premium one i.e. you need to subscribe to read those,1
Didn't like the personalized sales pitch.,1
The fact that readers must be a member of Medium before they can like or comment is just not cool.,1
Good reads. Pay to read,1
it’s a disservice or it seems that way to me in reference to having to pay for a membership to read a full article.,1
"its good but paid, but good.",1
Good apps Wonderful app and really SOMETHING have,1
It's a great platform to share ones thoughts,1
"it's good, but no longer free",1
They should add pagination for e-ink devices,1
i was enjoying until i was asked to upgrade. that sucks a lot,1
Should improve the sign in process,1
Would be exciting if it's not a paid one,1
It's kind of a tease the article seemed fairly shallow,1
i like this app except for the in-app purchases,1
On hand; commedable strickly business reach out's for it to be long distant! Honestly; J.M.,1
the experience with the Medium application is an experience of medium use,1
I have a free membership but all my daily recommendation are of premium posts. Is this a conversion strategy?,1
Good app... Easy to maneuver,1
I cannot stand applications that show notifications for none obvious reasons.,1
content is excellent but most of them arr paid. I am not here for paid things.,1
New logo is disaster,1
may the accumulated knowldgable book is succefull.,1
everything is good but snipts of code are not making sense.,1
sad that i have to pay to read,1
great app but with a price😄😁,1
it's often a useful experience in understanding the knowledge,1
Great app for readers,1
Wish that I can read more stuff before I am asked for an update.,1
Too much lock articles,1
"good, but would be better about all topics",1
I am try to understand,1
I can't upload my photos,1
this app needs to cache the data offline,1
"You are also charging for free contents ,",1
They keep money!,1
This is very loving and encouraging.,1
please add google translate feature,1
Mostly paid content,1
Great. Wish it was completely free.,1
Not loading widget in android 9,1
All of them are great writers. I can't compete with all of them.,1
Quite enlightining and fun to know,1
"Compared to the website, its the same",1
it's good but aways require upgrade,1
Need more free content,1
It was great and inspiring.,1
Service has degraded over the time,1
I'd loved it because it kept boosting my capability and self esteem. Looking forward for more,1
you read like 3 articles and then it's the hard paywall,1
"It is sad to see such increased vitriol against Christian faiths. It is coming, yes I know, but nothing to delve into the root cause. A loving Savior gave His life for all mankind, and freely gives the gift of life. And this is to all men. If you would take the time and really read the new testament, not logically, but openly 'What does this mean to me?', then let's discuss this.",1
Need subscription to read...,1
If only you could get paid from claps in South Africa,1
Dark mode is broken.,1

Lovely write ups/opinions & some facts,1
why for now . I can't save to offline mode,1
good but in app purchase,1
I only see articles that requires me to be a member. Can you add articles that is also for free users like me? Not everyone can afford your membership.,1
"no offline reading? bad, bad...",1
I keep getting suggested articles for topics I'm not interested in,1
I face problem in uploading my profile picture,1
I never get to read more then one. Love this but cant afford to scrbe ty,1
Use too much space,1
Make it free. Get 5 stars,1
I get to read a lot of good things,1
I found some that was better,1
"It's about time brands look into their business pricing according to local markets, India dosen't deal with dollar or most of us don't have credit card and yet the pricing is in dolars. Moreover for students in this country who would benifits the most simply cannot afford it",1
I can't save my place when reading.,1
a good app. what I expected,1
"it's cool, I started using the app, few minutes... I guess I'm going to love it.",1
It's a nice app to hang on with😂,1
Nice But I want to get lower Monthly paid,1
I'm just getting started but it seems pretty simple,1
Short trial period,1
content is good.,1
It is beyond me why a website where non-paid writers want to reach anybody who might be interested in what they have to say is paid. How is this helping society? Wikipedia needs to do way more vetting on a daily basis and is free.,1
"Hey Kyle Korkink...! Are you the same Kyle located near St George, Utah?",1
It will take time to explore,1
How do people see your stories & how long will you be a ghost on here? Why do you charge a fee to read too? I was excited for this for a minute...,1
Should be free to read,1
"Cool! to share the experience of other studious individuals over the world. However, was locked out after about 4 articles, the Admin could work at it being free?",1
"Price too high for poor students. Maybe one day, I will be able to afford it.",1
All they want for you to do is subscribe to the service it's a paid service. They let you read a few articles and then want your money.,1
Give free access,1
I wish they showed me equal numbers of unpaid stories as paid ones.,1
Awesome app.Great for anyone,1
can you find another way to make money and make the app comoletely free?,1
Invaluable insights therein. Just more than Amazing.,1
I am not sure yet of whether I like this app. Please ask me at a later date.,1
Its cool for learning programming faster...,1
good app. you have my 3-stars rating for your creative and educative contents.,1
"Now they made it commercial , not a right place for one to share their learnings",1
Better to spend your time here rather than on instagram.,1
getting use tothe news in Medium,1
Good i have not understand if they will pay or not,1
some connect perfectly with others. I believe that this would balance over the population,1
let us write articles on mobile and we'll give you 6 stars.,1
"So far, interesting; still examining the entirety.",1
Web is good.now I am going to download app,1
"Just started with it, So can't say much but it's good",1

Not cool at all. I realy love medium but pay to read ruined my day.,1
Really wish i had readers,1
I dont have Much Knowledge about Bank ProceeduresUnless I read and Understand I cant go ahead ok.,1
It's too costly is the only thing I feel uncomfortable with.,1
"if only i had $50, I'd give a 5 star rating",1
If it let me edit and see my publications in the app it would be rated higher,1
I don't know what to say about this app. I need to use it for a while,1
why do i have to pay within the apps??,1
Not what I was looking for. I know that is not what I but it's not what I was looking for. At some point I will be thinking about this information.,1
Can you please add payment option in Indian currency for Indian users.,1
I'm(Edwin M. Gonzales)Admin),1

I gave it 3 star cos I am not done exploring it yet,1
Cant read due to the add,1

I don't like the switch to a pay wall,1

Dark mode is quite terrible. The contrast between black background and white font is to high. The black should be more greyish. Also the clap button blocks itself and it goes up to 50 claps. Please improve it. All other features are ok.,1

The only thing that bothers me is when checking my profile or other people profiles the app takes a lot of time to render the results am not sure why but other than that and the fact that I can only read limited number of posts under free membership, it all good!",1
"Medium is for writers; Penzu is for me, but Medium is for readers (once I decide to get things out of draft mode and hit PUBLISH and add up to 5 tags.) Doing foreign language tags is just a bit more of a challenge than it should be. But THIS BUG TODAY ?!?",1

I just get ""you've reached your limit"" even though I haven't been able to access a single full article since September. I also felt like before that I he also just surfaced a lot very samey content and some work on the discovery algo would be beneficial. This is partly why I don't subscribe, because it's quite samey for me.",1

used to be great but too much paid content now reduces the time I read and increases the amount of time I spend looking for stuff to read. almost feels like having a reading app without browsing.,1
wow,1
nice app,1
the free version is very limited for reading. I appreciate the overal quality of the app though,1
Not able to say anything because all the articles and the experience is behind the paywall,1
Useful,1
Increase the number of articles in the premium which we can read in each month.,1
it's cool,1
Variety of brilliant content makes it unique . Nice way of sharing ideas. Clean.Engaging.Enjoyable. BUT the overall content is strongly geared towards paid subscribers. Free uses in my opinion are slowly being marginalised on this platform.,1

O.k,1
"In the days of social media, Medium is the only real place to share real thoughts and for someone to read them. Half an year later, the app is pretty much useless to the free user. Every suggested article requires paid membership. Viva la incognito browser mode :)",1
"Erm, I can't see how many claps an article has anymore?",1
"Great articles, but the home page feed could be better.. A lot of articles are very old. Navigation to a particular topic is not straightforward. Very often scrolling all the way down to find nothing interesting. Wonder if the paid members get better experience",1
Its okay,1

"The app is very well designed, and stories can be solid. But while I understand the need to monetize journalism, the problem, medium content can hardly be called that. It's more of an aggregated array of blogs. Some good, some not so. That begs the question, is $50/year good value for what you get? Personally I don't think so. While Medium claims they share some profits with top writers, there is no official data on how much they collect vs what they share. This makes me think that they are mostly collecting subscription cash for next to nothing, for themselves while contributing no content of their own. Quality app/web development has costs, but surely it can be subsided with ads. Personally, I'd be willing to pay $20-25 per year for ad free content that's well presented, but $50 is just too steep for me.",1
"For an app that shows mainly text, it consumes a lot of data (like 30Mb in two days of not-very-heavy usage).",1
"Simplistic app for reading some interesting content. The UX and UI of this app is a little too unpolished for my taste, as this service definitely deserves a smooth and beautiful user experience.",1
"I really wish this app had a history tab where you can see what you have 
read... So when the app crashes or you switch to another app for a bit and 
the OS decides to kill it at least you'll have a way to go back to where 
you were. The moment you get this I'll be the happiest user ever :)",1
"Nowadays, it shows up only member stories in my home feed. Couldn't find any good recommendations of 'non-member' stories.",1
I just really want you to know it only sends emails at 4 AM,1
The only think missing is immersive mode,1
"Hi Medium. I am a big fan, but the app is so disappointing. I edit my 
articles online and don't see the exact changes on the app. I created a 
series on the website. Pushed it to my app (as notified on the top). 
Updated the app version to avoid any conflicts, and still nothing. I just 
published a series but it does not show on my app. It is so irritating. The 
Webapp is good, but the Android app... I just hope you read this and do 
something about it. After a long time, when the series appeared on my app, 
I could not see the title. I still cannot see the title.",1
Consume a lot battery,1
"The reading experience is quite poor. If you reopen the app it does not 
remember even the last article you were reading (not mentioning the 
position within) so you have to find it again and again. With poor internet 
connection it might not show even the saved (bookmarked) articles",1
"Great to have all these reading choices at your fingertips. One really 
annoying bugs where an article won't open despite clicking multiple times 
need fixing.",1
"Finally uninstalled, constantly asking me to subscribe. If willing to pay, 
great app. If unsure or not willing, don't bother.",1
"Makes my phone heat up. Not sure why but I am thinking about switching back 
to the webapp.",1
Why can't i upload pictures ? I have been struggling with this for the past few days,1

why we can't read alot in a month? It's not free 😕,1

subscription is well worth the cost. However, I'm having so many issues 
opening content on the app. The screen will go black half way through an 
article and the app will entirely stop working. I lose the article I'm 
reading and on top of that, it won't let me open any more articles. It just 
stays stuck on the black screen.",1
"It's a bit unfair that the app doesn't inform you that you can only read a 
limited amount of articles for free. After like 5 opened articles you have 
to subscribe.",1
"It's a good app, but, for God's sake, it should let we write drafts offline.",1
"Push notifications are enabled but not working :( with app open or 
closed... I can't use the preview series like this",1
"Often when I open the app the story I was reading is gone and there is no 
history feature to find it again.",1
"Hello dev team it does not work on my Samsung Tab E, while it works on my 
Samsung S3 Neo. Both have Android 4.4.4. The links to posts inside the app 
do not open.",1
I can not open any stories from bookmark. Please help,1
"I love medium website and I was so happy when I saw the android app for it. 
For some reason this app keeps on crashing on Oreo 8.0 (Samsung S8) please 
fix it to make it awesome again.",1
"I changed the brightness through medium just for the sake of trying it & 
now i have no way to tell it to adjust to my phone's brightness. Please fix 
it guys.. !",1
"Overall i liked the app. But i found a bug when ever i scroll down till the 
end, some times it just crashes",1
"Great sleek app that keeps you wanting to read more. But keeps crashing 
when opening medium links from email or browser.",1
"It would be nice to know how many articles I have read or haven't read on 
bookmark. It's hard to keep track.",1
Please consider to add feature for article page refresh and image refresh,1
"3 stars because I'm tired of being asked to rate your app every time I 
click on the clapping button",1
"Just a little alignment is needed as the text is going a little out of the 
screen. The app needs to be a little more responsive and justified please 
kindly see to the same :)",1
"Good app. Except sometimes no text shows up. I have dark mode enabled and 
it happens whenever I scroll out of my screen region. Or after a code 
block. Reopening the article sometimes helps.",1
"Performance issues while scrolling through articles. Dropped frames make it 
jittery. I had to stop reading because I couldn't take it anymore.",1
"There are some great articles available on Medium. However, what passes for 
premium content is a joke. Furthermore, premium content isn't clearly 
marked.",1
This should be free. I don't like that it costs money.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this app, however, there are many ways to improve. For 
starters: 1. Automatic scrolling when reading would make reading a much 
more comfortable experience 2. Seriously improve upon the added features 
for premium. It infuriates me whenever I want to read an article but can't 
when I don't wish to subscribe. Sure, it provides writers income but there 
should be more features than such other than blocking out non-premium 
readers 3. Fix the way how readers can make comments and express their 
opinions. As always, reddit is a prime example of this",1
"Im using the app for writing and what I really would like to have is to be 
able to add for photos from Unsplash. At the moment only the desktop 
version allows that. What happens is a rarely find the time to be on destop 
mode to publish.",1
"It's good because it educates you on so many things and broadens your mind 
on many interests.",1
Not interested in paying to read generally mediocre articles.,1
Great app but I couldn't add highlights just like the web,1
0.还没有更新适配Android P，1.还不支持代码语法高亮。2.创新功能不足。3. 无法评论,1
Gets the job done. But isn't very elegant,1
"Personal highlights from old articles I've read don't show up properly on 
an article. It does show up on my profile. Since the highlights don't show 
up correctly I can't even unhighlight things I don't want to she on my 
profile.",1
"For the love of all that is good, can we please have a splash screen that 
doesn't look like a child made it using Superpaint on a Macintosh LC from 
1992? (Or even better, no splash at all - it's unnecessary.)",1
"This is very helpful for me when i read same in website designing and 
developing so i am very happy with this app i suggest you to read from there",1
It's good until you reach the number of news for free users...,1
"I would have given 5 stars, but they are not paying the artists/writers for 
their content and then charging readers for it. There is a lot of content 
that non-premium users can't access. If they're not paying the writers for 
it, it should be unrestricted. They should find other premium features to 
charge for, not the writing itself.",1
"Virtually every article is behind a pay-wall so you can't even read anything without subscribing. If you are willing and able to pay $50 a year you may enjoy this platform. More so if you like to write. However, it seems like exposure to your work is pretty limited since only other members can read it.",1
"I've already specified the topics I want to follow. And yet somehow, some 
of those topics I didn't follow appear on my feed. Please fix this. It 
takes up space in the feed and takes me a longer time to scroll. I suggest 
a functionality that lets me remove a card which I don't want to appear on 
my feed. Please. Thank you",1
Still the app crashes sometime when the profile is being opened.,1
"Need 1. Font customization. 2. Zoom in-out. 3. More themes. 4. More home 
page customization. Please reply.",1
App sucks when requesting to follow someone,1
Nice overall,1
"Great looking loading screen too bad it doesn't work past that. Can't use any sign in or sign up option without it glitching out, so totally unusable.   Have un/reinstalled, same story. Lots of flickering like there are a bunch of processes going on but something errors and it asks me to try again.  Still a fan of Medium the site but this app doesn't work at all on my Pixel 2.  EDIT: Email sign up works, its just social sign in that is broken. Still very frustrating but i gave you back some stars!",1
"I wish they make it free in countries like India. 5$ a month is a lot of 
money when converted to INR. So please ask readers to contribute or allow 
more ads, but please make it free, so that everyone can benefit from the 
knowledge and content",1
The UI has some lags moving throughout sections,1
"No Reading History. No proper restoring of the state when the app is 
getting closed or the phone rebooted.",1
"Sadly on my low income $5/month is well beyond my means. The article limit 
per month for free users is way too low; never mind that there was no 
indication of a limit until I reached it. If I'd have known I may have been 
a bit more careful with my choices. Yes it's worth the money, it's just 
money I don't have.",1
Writers need to have the options on the app that they have on the PC e.g. adding to publications; captions under images; private notes. It's not worth having a limiting app!,1
May it back my lost photos in gallery and in Google photos,1
"An easy access app for all the medium articles but, putting a prompt to rate your app on tap of claps button was an extremely bad idea, you lost a star because of that in this review",1
I wish it was free all the way.,1
White screen when loads,1
"Buried somewhere in the Help is the fact that not all of the writing tools are here.  The reading experience is also cut-down, a taster menu rather than a smorgasbord.  Odd that when the world is going mobile, Medium goes the other way.",1
"I was really expecting more from Medium, the blogging platform that I and millions of others have come to adore. Please consider the fact that people are mainly going to use this app for reading, and provide basic reader friendly features like background, font size, style etc. Or at least respect the user's settings and allow for system font size and family to be applicable in the app. I'm sure most of the positive reviews here are for the platform itself and not this app.",1
The only thing I dislike from this app is that the scrolling was unpleasant on a long article because of the delay,1
Here can we write in hindi ? Yes or No ?,1
Just arrived !,1
And finally logo comes in launcher thanks for the updates.,1
It was working well until a few days ago. But now I can't log in to the app. So I am back to the website. This is really frustrating.,1
No changelog available for app changes :( Would be 5 stars otherwise.,1
This app should be free.,1
Needs a dark theme.,1
Awesome reading experience,1
"Only 3 stars because the in-app browser cannot be disabled in the settings. I have to tap ""open in chrome"" every time I want to open a link. This should imho be adjustable in the settings",1
"Good articles but please add offline support. I can't read anything if I have no network, not even my bookmarked articles",1
"It's cool, but lacks features iPhone and web has. You can't publish to a publication like iPhone. You can't make a series like iPhone. Not a bad app, they just don't seem to want to give Android the same level of support. Talked to customer support and they don't seem to have any plans on doing this either.",1
"The app is nice enough the way it is, but it should offer more features than what you already get in the browser, like automatically making the latest articles from followed authors available for offline reading. Otherwise, it's just a web view where you can't open new tabs or save images.",1
My only problem with this app is that you must pay to get access to certain functions that I think should be free. I can't submit a draft of my work to publishers on the platform and I think that's very annoying.,1
There is a problem in the last update.. nothing shown in the app!!!,1
It's elegant and user friendly,1
It is very good,1
Good. Will be great if it comes with offline reading mode.,1
The should be a provision for dictionary.,1
Need offline support.,1
It's OK to dive in,1
I downloaded the app but i am not able to sign in. Kindly help me out with this issue.,1
"Please commit to making detailed ""what's new"" notes for each update.  Missing or generic release notes are a wasted opportunity to encourage and excite your user community.  For technology oriented people, it's also a differentiator between products and customer service teams.  With love.",1
"OK in terms of post classification and display, not quite in terms of data usage (750 mb in less than 3 weeks without listening to audio, which is quite a lot for just text and image)",1
"Please make latin and cirillic fonts consistent, it's 2018.",1
Very good app for inspiration,1
"The app is a good daytime reader. No ""night mode"" available which is when I do most of my reading means I have to look up articles on the web, send them to instapaper and then read them there, a lot more comfortably on a dark background with adjustabke margins and line spacing. But then if I want to highlight something I want associated with my account or share, quote or comments on it with the author, I have to do the reverse. It's inconvenient enough to encourage me to write this review. Also, scrolling often llags more frequently  than reading  the same article  on the web, which leads me to think they are  behavior-mining reading speed or scrolling habits for engagement measurement. Thars a bit more intrusive than I'm comfortable with. The app is good for   your own writing and to publish later. Although I'd you want to make sure your published articles look as you'd expect both on mobile and the web, I'd recommend to always check your draft on the desktop version before publishing. Sometimes the image sizing is not quite consistent with the published version. It's not impossible to do, though, Telegra.ph does, but it doesn't have the audience that medium does. So for the moment network effects dictate that Medium it is, for publishing to a wider audience and article discovery. Try Telegram+Telegra.ph though. Combining Telegram's massive channels with Telegra.ph may evolve into a Medium killer, if they put their minds to it or if Medium keeps ignoring simple but basic reader features like ""night mode"" and adjustable margins and line spacing",1
The app's OK. But what a brilliant ad! You've got a lot to live up to.,1
Great App.  Please make full screen view available i.e. Hidden status and navigation bars.,1
"The app is solid with quality content.  My issue though is that when ""Reading List"" is tapped, the app crashes and that is a major issue for me as I am unable to access my bookmarks.  I strongly advice to take care of this bug.",1
"Nice UI. But, could you please add a button to hide ""member only"" article? And a button to hide ""suggestion for you"" sections? Or maybe you can move those things to other tab, not in the home. Because everytime I open the app, I see a bunch of articles that I can't read (I'm not a member), and not interested to me. Thank you",1
It would be really helpful if there's an option for changing the font size. The text appears so big on my Android phone it is quite distracting to read on. Please add this option to the settings! Thank you.,1
"Great for reading, not great for writing. Buggy, bad formatting behavior.",1
"Highlighting is not working and that means a lot of time wasted after I read something that later I want to check on the important parts I've found. Right after I highlight something, I keep reading and as I move to the bottom, the highlight just vanish from where I've put it. Fix ASAP.",1
"Great for consuming content, horrible for creating it - can't even create Series.",1
The editor could use a lot of improvements,1
good app,1
"Glitchy app.  Became a member. Started reading  members-only article. However,  couldn't finish my article bc the app doesn't 're recognize me as a paid member.  I logged off, logged back on. Still the same thing.",1
"The app is awesome no doubt but what the hell, paid content ?!!!! why would you guys lock the information. I'm a new user but now i feel like this is bad...",1
Great source of learning. But why can't it just reopen the article I was reading? Even sometimes when switching to another app I have to scroll or search again for the article I was just reading. Which is a tedious task. Is bookmark = offline mode. Because bookmarks seem to work in a random way. Before you launch the subscription stuff those problems were not there,1
its a nice app with good content. But not useful without a simple feature of font adjustment. its pretty inconvenient to read with small fonts. atleast the app should provide a way to increase / decrease font size. I wonder how the developer forgot to put this important feature.,1
So informative ....keep it up developers,1
"I enjoy Medium. The format is great and a pleasure to read. My big problems are the clapping system, which makes it very hard to really say what you think about an author, and that it doesn't do a great job of showing the user new content.",1
"I am not able to use the highlight feature of this app, since I switched to MIUI. The MIUI has a default text selection feature which seems to override your selection. I tried on other apps like Google play books where similar text selection highlight is there, but they seemed to be working fine. I checked with other MI phones, they also facing similar issue. Please help.  If anyone reading this faced this issue, let me know.",1
"""Get Started"" button is totally broken, Applause button is too easy to accidentally spam. Free version lacks offline mode. Not likely to continue to use app",1
What is the deal with login with email. Why can't you just give us password?,1
What's with premium and not premium articles and what does it even mean,1
Idk what to say lol,1
Need a lot of improvements in the app. The option to write the story disappears slowly after scrolling the feed. Can't give Title to my post by default like it's available on browser. I love medium on the Web but would like to use the app for convenience.,1
"Gave it a while but I dislike the new design. My favorite feature was that I could easily see what's been published on my favorite publications from the homepage. This was either completely removed or hidden to the point that I can't find it. Would you please consider bringing the old design back? This new home page is quite terrible. I'm sorry to say that. Content still rocks, it's just more difficult to find it.",1
"Dont like the new home screen, I get a lot less of the articles from the topics I follow.",1
"Not like iOS app. In iOS app I can load more stories in any section, in Android I see only few and there is no load more while scrolling down.",1
The new icon does't show on the oppo mobile ... Please fix the bug.thanks,1
Please accept membership via Android pay,1
Your new logo sucks,1
I love this app. I get to read great pieces.,1
"Medium has slowly become an important part of my weekly, sometimes even daily, life. The app is my only way which I access content on Medium, and I love it. The UI is friendly and inviting and the features are fantastic so far.",1
"I like the old logo better,  there's sort feeling of community and now it looks like your usual news app. But the major problem is how you changed the heart icon into applaud. I don't know which direction you aimed to but it certainly wipes out the idea of community that we had before.",1
"There's nothing wrong with the app per se, but it feels like an afterthought compared to the website. Quite a few features are missing, there are some weird disconnects in user experience. It's perfectly pleasant for reading, but given that I use the mobile app as my primary Medium portal, I annoyingly have to open my laptop just to give certain types of feedback about an article or to make a comment.",1
"I like the app but whenever i write a story, i couldn't edit the tags. It keeps coming back to the unapplied tags and there's no completion button to apply the tags i added so if keeps coming back to the start where i haven't put any tags and it adds ""fiction"" tag by itself. Please fix this.",1
Icon is not displayed on my Oppo A57. It just is a blank area with the name of the app in text below.,1
Great apps but why do you change the icon? It looks so bad now,1
"There is a bug where when you scroll up in the feeds section the ""write new article"" button supposedly fades away but never comes back even on scrolling down, unless you force close the app and start it again.",1
"Good app. BUT! I can click to link only one time! Second and other times nothing happend, web-browser don't open. Xiaomi Mi5, official software",1
The new version does not have a proper Icon with my Android 6,1
Why you'll changed the icon...,1
Have tons of great article but many of the button not working Not sure if its my smartphone or the apps,1
"One of the best reading platform,I've ever used just installed it and get reading great job by the design structure.",1
The icon doesn't load new logo on my device. It shows default android icon.,1
Older version was good especially the previous logo. Didn't​ like the current logo and there no notifications too.,1
Change icon and add story type book as B4,1
سلام وقت بخیر عالی چون. ترکیب. اصلی. کارخانه. خودش. حفظ. کرده. موفق. باشید,1
Why this new ancient logo? That's where my 3 star review comes from. Not sure I get your strategy here.,1
"Horrible Icon! Please change it, revert back to the old one!",1
"Really like medium as a blogging platform. I like that they have clear, consistent modern styling. However, the app is not great for finding content and the new logo is just hideous. Looks like a logo for a Windows 95 word processing app. The app is currently letting the platform down as a whole",1
Where is the stories? Newest update sucks -_-,1
"Can read and choose publication. But can't ""clap"" a post through this app tablet version. Rant: why rename recommend to clap? It seems to me a useless change that does not bring anything new or even enhances the meaning of the action.",1
Basically useless... Needs app to read news from other sources...this is not a good practice. Better use chrome SDK to implement website integration on chrome tabs rather than forcing users' device to open the app. Secondly it's too costly compared to what you give for free.,1
Funny,1
"The reading experience is great. The editing is experience as an author is terrible. If you want someone else to give you feedback on a draft, use Google docs. Weird character limits, no editing of your own private comments, and no simple editing (e.g. strikethrough) make this just awful for an author.",1
"Content is great, but running on LG L22C / Android 5.0.1, consistently crashes to home screen on opening certain articles. (My carrier doesn't allow OS updates, so that's not an option. ) The crashes are very annoying, use app less than I would like to. Contacted Medium about the issue, but no fix yet.",1
Cannot listen to member-only audio. Please fix it!,1
I can't sign in😔it works to me before now no luck at all,1
"I'm not a fan of writers using curse words in their headlines and in their writing to emphasize the intensity of their points. I still believe there's a place for decency online, and great writing should be writing that can be read by my grandma without her feeling disrespected by the writers use of swear words. Before Medium few of us had such an awesome writing interface, so we should treat the opportunity/platform with respect. Please do something about it---for quietly such language is turning readers away from Medium. Thanks.",1
"After coming back to the app, the app freezes and I have to restart the app, find the article again..",1
Edit: I miss the days this app was actually free to read unlimited articles.,1
I wish you hadn't changed the layout,1
App automatically closes within minutes,1
"This is a cool platform for reader and writer. I love it so much. The stories I've found are dope. Unfortunately, my smartphone couldn't highlight any word in it. I dont know why. I long tap the word(s), but there is no option for highlighting. Also, I hope, medium provide posting to publication directly using mobile phone. Because until now, I can only submit writings to publication through pc.",1
"Too much form over function. For example, you can't search topics, tags or people(!). Using apps like this leaves you feeling slightly dirty, like you've just been used to promote their brand.",1
"What happened to the home page? It's much less useful. It used to show publication articles I've missed out on, recommended articles, and all that but now it only shows a couple recommended ones and bookmarked articles. It is much less useful now, I don't even know how to catch up on all the articles I've missed out on.",1
Not as bad as when Flipboard dropped the ball but not great either. The old layout was better. Too much Drumpf news.,1
I see 'Series' as an option. But I don't see an option to create a series. Please allow me to create a series. This is an app and product I absolutely love. Giving it a 3 just to get the right attention.,1
I was not able to signin to the application.,1
"Slow, boring.",1
"The (at least for now, members only) offline reading list is flaky. When you need it, it won't load unless you go back and forth multiple times, and the saved articles are not fully available (viz.images). The AM/PM/eve editions often contain articles one's already read and archived.",1
"Excellent histories, but the UI is ok, and the login with a Google account, forced you to access your contacts, even when you can deny it (but doesn't open the app if you do so)",1
"So far good, but need some feature in this app to make better experience. Some of desktop feature not sync with app.",1
Who came up this new logo design? Get back the earlier one!,1
couldnt you make Offline saving of articles to read without connection ?,1
It crashes a lot,1
It's a great app. I have a problem with how messy my feeds/home page gets. It should be easier to control my timeline instead of having so many articles shoved into my face all the time. And the desktop version lets you edit the title of the article while the mobile app doesn't - why??,1
"I've gone through and found wonderful people to follow and wanted a place to see their stories. It's incredibly tedious to get past the (awkwardly +  inadequately) curated content and see the stories I've already given input on that I want to see.   I don't want to have to go into my profile, click following, and go into each person's profile I follow just to check if they have any new posts. I want the people I follow to show up on the home feed. And yes, every single story that each of them write - not curated by anything but myself.",1
"The biggest pain is that it's so hard to find articles from people I follow. If someone I follow writes an article it should show first....not the recommended articles. To find it, I have to go to my profile, search for the person in my follow list and go to their profile. Completely unnecessary",1
"I like the app, it's a great way to pass time during daily commutes, but it's extremely data hungry for a reading app even with everything disabled in settings. Would love to see improvements on mobile data saving functionalities.",1
Good app but must need a signing in app itself. Unable to sign-in​ devices in which I don't have my email.,1
"I love the content, and almost everything about it...But damn is there a niggle. Forcing me to login via an email is a pain as, like many other people, I retrieve my email through Gmail and it's not instant. By the time the email arrives the token has expired! Why can't I just use a password?",1
"The app still works better on iOS than on Android. There are some bugs here. I have reported them, but I haven't heard back from the people at Medium. Having said that, I recommend you download the app and start reading and writing!",1
used massive amounts of data. will continue to use the site on my computer but i don't have tons of extra data to burn on my phone so the 1Gb i used in 3 days actively using this app is too much,1
Please support offline saving of unfinished articles.  Will will save the sync cycles that will make the composing of articles faster and responsive.,1
"First impression: it's missing some basic reading reading features I like in the mobile Chrome browser, starting with ""find in place"". I need to be able to search for text in the current article I'm reading. Otherwise, it's smooth and easy to read.",1
Somehow I'm unable to upload photo to article,1
Why this app is always updating? I have update this app 5 times. Why?,1
Great app..  But would be nice if the contents can be cached,1
tilting on series is not working,1
The UI on pre-lollipop is pretty bad and it's very difficult to watch video from the app.,1
It crashes all the time when I come from Google suggestions,1
It's a very good app but now day I am facing issues that this app got automatically close while doing Scroll Up or down it's very irritating. Give updates so I will not face such issues in future.,1
"Please, add widget support. Preview of newsfeed on the desktop would be very nice without opening the app.",1
"Would be nice to have  all the desktop features, but still to me this one of the best things in the web this days. UPDATE: It is very disappointing the removal of medium in Spanish publication, therefore, that together with the lack of all web features make me go down to 3 stars. Still like the app and the web.",1
I like medium. I really wanted the app but installing this app crashes my stock launcher repeatedly. I was forced to uninstall it. It ll be grt if the issue is solved.    Note: Version 3.3.2476 works fine without any problem.,1
Some interesting content to be found amongst the dross and empty vessels. Arcane and annoying app login.,1
Why does this app need all these permissions to my contacts  in uninstalling,1
"Series can't be uploaded through app, series don't get updated very soon",1
"Needs a lot more material design loving to it, but It otherwise medium as a product is great!",1
What's the point of having an app of it can't be used while offline..,1
The only problem with this app is that tags can't be added to postings before publication.,1
Desperately needs offline reading,1
Waiting for right-to-left languages support!,1
No changelog?? Come on!,1
I don't get notifications when someone comments on my article. And there's no place for that in the settings,1
Good to use. Budding user. Let me explore and review back,1
Love it,1
Amazing Great,1
"I can't manage my publication from the app, its very unfulfilling, please add some features",1
I enjoyed reading various articles but have left it idle for quite some time. I decided to open it up again but to find all pictures showing up blank. Tried reinstalling but didn't work. Any solutions? Edit: now nothing shows up..?,1
I use it a lot for writing on my tablet.  But I can't add my writing to my publications.  I need to wait to be on a computer for this.  Also I can't use my writing apps to paste the text I wrote. Again I need to wait until I am on front of a computer. Otherwise one of my favourite apps!,1
Deliberately needs updates. Many many many bugs,1
U should make offline reading a thing,1
I really like the app..However I had to uninstall it just cause it downloaded 400 MB of data when I just read 10-20 articles this month...No way an app should download this much data unless it is a video platform like YouTube. Moving over to web!!  App version: 3.6.4569 Pixel XL OS version:  7.1.2,1

"Crashes a lot, night mode is broken (only the first few article cards are dark colored on the main feed), clicking the follow button on a publication doesn't seem to sync when you leave and re-enter a publisher's page. Overall design is nice though and is easy to use.",1
"The contents are fantastic, and fascinating. But the app is really slow. It seems like it has a lot of bugs to be resolved. All this can be solved is caching of data would be introduced. :)",1
"Works smoothly and it's easy to write blogs. However, I can only write blogs on my own profile and not part of a publication.",1
There's a huge disparity between the features available on the browser vs the app,1
No option to publish on Publications.,1
"Just updated and the new layout is terrible, looks messy and is annoying.",1
"... As an editor of a publication I cannot find a way to switch to that view and, for example, see stats for my stories",1
Tried logging in with different account and it won't accept any of them! Useless!   I can now log on and make an account wahoo! It looks great and I've had fun browsing through the different sections. I'm looking forward to posting some stuff!,1
"Impossible to figure out.  Unable to comment on the story I want, keeps sending me to an empty app requiring personalization.",1
The one thing I would like to get added is multi account support so that I can run my publication and I can use my personal account,1
Ive tried all 3 options of sign up and errors keep coming. Ive tried uninstall and install it back - didnt worked.,1
"Should have a feature to turn off image downloads when connected to WiFi. Need to restart the app to stop image loading when on cellular network. Content wise, really good app.",1
Can't log in,1
In the end I went to the website to sign up and then signed in from the app.  Works fine but it's not a great intro to an app,1
"Why is it impossible to add articles to my own publication? Without this function the app is mostly useless for writers, not for readers, of course.",1
Not able to sign in even after using all the options present please clarify my query as soon as possible,1
"Tried to sign up with Google and Twitter, both failed.",1
"Login does not work, will not let you sign up. Makes app, completely pointless. Based on other reviews this has been inoperable for a week now. EDIT: what you can do is create an account using Google on the Medium website and then you can login to your Google account from the app. That worked for me.  EDIT: ok I got the editor working, kinda hard to find it.",1
Lots of non professional writers. Some good. Most mediocre.,1
"Easy to read, easy to navigate, and the app works well, but some buttons appear deformed, which is such an eyesore for a beautiful app like this. Please fix it.",1
"Medium is an amazing blogging platform, with delightful resources and astonishing looks. However, it would be even better if it were possible to directly reply to a comment (or at least find out the commenter's username through the app). Also, the option to strikethrough text would be a welcome addition. P. S.: please, allow users to write drafts even when offline. There's no point in having to turn 4G connection on to write stuff.",1
"This is still new for me,but it's easier for me to use and if it doesn't change I will use it more than facebook.",1
...but currently some images and videos (usually from The Ringer articles) don't load. All i see is a blank space where the media should be.,1
Please tell me how to put a title on my story?,1
"In most ways this is a great app. Smooth, responsive, pleasing content layout. But why in the world is there no way to zoom in on images? Medium articles often have images or infographics. In typical media interfaces either direct zoom of the page is supported, or at least the ability to pop out the graphic to a separate window that can be zoomed. Not supporting this ability seriously hampers an otherwise excellent experience, by leaving some content literally unintelligible.",1
Arabic language aligned left in both the app and the website. A problem solved by most other apps and software a long time ago.,1
Content is great but the app keeps crashing on certain articles.,1
"Even though I have followed a publications, it doesn't show up in the publications section. Keeps saying I haven't followed any. When I check the publication, it says I have followed them. It's a good app, maybe you guys could add more features :)",1
Please permission app move to SD card. Internal storage is completely full .not choice remove medium app from my phone.,1
I lovd medium and it's great the app is cool too. But I really don't appreciate an extra app on my already filled up and a slow phone with limited. It's forced because we can't write new medium stories using Mobile website and there fore we can't even respond.,1
I am not able to post content fully because it doesn't allow me to tag my posts. Fix this please.,1
Please add support to download articles that you can read offline,1
"Love Medium and the app, but there should be greater interface to edit work on owned publications.",1
Some improvement need in UI,1
"Could do with the option to change font type, font size, night mode etc. Would make reading the content a more pleasant experience.",1
Some of the articles take you to a empty screen and you have to force close the app. The articles display okay on the Medium website.,1
"Really like the app, but it's annoying that when you open web links it takes you out of the app and you lose track of what you were reading",1
"After uploading an image, it turns into a black, corrupted image. Fix?",1
I find it difficult to read because I cannot adjust the text size!!   Please think about this  point.         Other things are good,1
"if I open medium through a link in Chrome, medium says I am not signed in, which is not true. And cannot signin from that page",1
You had the function of having a tick symbol next to read articles which somehow gone missing. That needs to be sorted right away.,1
"your ""letter""",1
Follow button doesn't work on a single click. Search displays the searched topic twice.,1
I have to open up my web browser to add my stories to the publication houses. And you guys don't even notify when someone leaves a note on the story. There are other options related to editing that are not provided in the app. Please see to it.,1
I would most likely give this 5 stars if it was working correctly. The drafts and stats page–as well as a few others–do not load at all and just hang.,1
"After having used this app for a couple of months now, I think it's okay to say that I've seen better.      At least, the website is far more user-friendly than the app. The most annoying thing about it is that I can't for the life of me go to the home screen from an article page. That's just not cool.",1
Good site to interface with; kinda obtuse interface. Very annoying you have to use their app to comment on stories while on mobile.,1
I found it yesterday by accident when I try to find some foems I love from my favorite writer. its content so inspiring and rich. I love it,1
"I can access my own unlisted stories on the mobile website, so this should be made possible in the app",1
Its Simple & Great,1
"The app is wonderful to use. The articles written are too good. But one glaring issue I experienced is whenever I tried to upload a profile image, it says unable to upload. If this is solved them definitely gonna give 5 stars.",1
It was all about stories we cared about. Now it's all about stories they think we should care about :P,1
"It is my pleasure to use your app guys keep it up,we need some cool futures.... 😉",1
"Overall, if you're writing on medium it's essential. If you're not use the mobile site.",1
"I like the site and greatly appreciate the interface but I feel there are  couple of points, one of which I'm surprised is even an issue. I go in and unless I'm on the home feed, I can't write a post or the way to write a post isn't readily visible. Bottom line if I have to hunt for that script icon because it's not ready for me to use on ANY screen, that's a fail on the developers' part. Second, I have two medium accounts and I have to log out instead of switching. Ugh! Not cool",1
"No ""info bubbles"" to explain editing/navigation symbols, for instance.",1
Keeps erasing last letter when I double tap space bar for period.,1
"Images don't load often.. Would be great to have a ""view in web browser"" option",1
Works as stated,1
"I downloaded medium quite sometime ago but only started using it recently. I thought it will all run of the mill click bait articles as most of them seem that way. However, medium is more. Its a place where you will come for the sleek shiny interface but stay for the wealth of writing directly from the people in the industry. The recent updates however has turned it once again into a run of the mill app or atleast on their way to be. I sincerely hope good things are in store for this platform.",1
"The images do not load when the device language is set to arabic, but for the rest this is my favourite blog app",1
Good application but needs an option to increase text size,1
Theme issues on marshmallow,1
App hesitates to scroll.  Have to move finger multiple times.  No other apps have this issue on my phone.  Moto X 2nd gen.,1
"Can't sign in. It says, ""Oops there is an error all the time"" . I have updated too.",1
Force closes frequently,1
I love medium. However the app does need some work. Especially with the UI,1
I would give 5 stars for offline reading,1
"I like Medium.  I like the stories.  I like the app. The notifications, however, need some work.  When the notifications come up on the phone, I don't want to necessarily read them right away but I would like to be able to save to read later and swipe away the notifications.  Also, one notification for a notification center or inbox on Medium for the multiple stories, please?  Two or more stories really crowds up the bar!",1
"How the hell do I unsubscribe from medium staff recommendations. All of them are so far out of my interest level that I get annoyed that I even read the headline, thinking it would be something interesting to me.",1
I got an email to get published but it didn't want to work so now I can't publish it and it was something great,1
"I love Medium and always use it for writing (and occasionally, I'll read an article if it sounds interesting), but the only reason I downloaded the app to my phone is to edit my writing, and continue writing. Everything else comes up fine, but it doesn't allow me to edit anything. It just freezes up where it's all green and I can't touch anything. If this was fixed, I'd give it a five!",1
"The articles are interesting but the app is sluggish when loading them. Seriously, a 5 second wait on the initial picture before I can start scrolling down? And try to read some of the longer comment responses with dots at the end of them to indicate they continue. Once you click on them, finish reading and hit the back button, there's a 2-3 second pause each time. Ever heard of caching? Anyway, it gets really tedious really quick, so much so that I'm considering dumping the app.",1
I generally stick with mobile sites rather than slow down my devices with apps. But I gave this a try. Glad I did. Suddenly able to readily surf more content than I did before. Good!  Not so good? Images authors insert in their stories I can't embiggen or pop out. Generally very critical to the story images are added. I can't see them. Yeah I need glasses and the ability to zoom.,1
Scrolling performance has taken a big hit.,1
I love medium but too bad you can't edit on mobile devices :(,1
"Also, many features that are in the website are missing in the app",1
This is a must have App if you like to read and publish your own.,1
Improving!!,1
The spellchecker can't learn new words. Occasionally backspace becomes delete for some reason. needs an option to turn off spellchecker,1
Update profile options?,1
"On my tablet, a Lenovo A3000 with Android, on the Medium app text looks ugly. Slightly blurry, too thin. Made worse by the fact that the app doesn't provide any settings to tweak appearance in any way. (Low light, dark background mode would be useful for peoplw who read too). Strange enough, smaler text renderwd on the home screen looks just fine.",1
"I often go offline with my phone, as I don't have data. I like to pre-open some articles at home to read them offline, but after leaving home, they won't stay in memory and I have nothing to read. Even Google chrome does better job here, it keeps it's open pages in the cache to access offline. Please update the otherwise excellent app to support offline reading, to pre-cache articles.",1
The interface keeps repeating the same stories as if it's stuck in some loop. All I can see is a couple of stories (5 to 6) and that's it. They keep on repeating.,1
"Would've loved to give it a 5 star, but the absence of image zooming is a big minus for my reading experience",1
"I like the idea of the app, but the writing experience is worse than other app. I try to a copy a story in draft, but it only copy one paragraph not all of the paragraph. It's often loading again with green background, when I leave it for a while to the other app. I mean, what wrong's with this app! A few minutes ago, when I copied a story from the other app and publish it. When I saw it, there wasn't any space there!(except the last paragraph that I make in this app). Please fix it! Or 2 star!",1
"I like the app but it really drives me crazy when I want to see an imagen in detail (for example in some reviews about apps)  ,  I mean I can't open or even zoom it, is basically the same problem with the font size.",1
"This works great as a reader, but there is no way I'd write on it. It would get four stars if it weren't for the fact that I've had trouble highlighting passages. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.",1
Requires the following feature to be included : highlighting a new sentence  within the mobile app,1
"Platform built is good but implementation could be better. Faster loading, you can prefetch some days too, provide support for offline reading and much better editor..at least allow rudimentary editing",1
"You can write a draft, can publish it under your account but cannot publish it to your publication. This virtually means that you cannot publish anything if you are using the Medium's ""publication"" system. For such kind of people, this app is an incomplete draft editor.",1
It's ok but needs work,1
"I do get it, I love the reading time estimates and the format on a hand-held...but the content is virtual reality banter firmly grounded in the US version of capitalism. It is the kind of thinking that gives us the monotonous sameness of malls and fast-food franchises that suck the life out of locations. I look forward to a wider spectrum of philosophies, cultural perspectives.",1
"Navigating through app is painfully slow and choppy on a modern phone with gpu. I love Medium, but you guys need to work on making this a better experience.",1
"Great platform, not so great app",1
"Its amazing that in this day and age, a service lacks the ability to let a user delete his/ her account. Several hails on twitter had no response, so have to assume no support is available on the topic. Uninstalled within hours of install.",1
"but would like to be able to see just the tags I have chosen and nothing else, some articles crash randomly too",1
The old version was much cooler,1
Its awesome and insightful writing.,1
"After the recent update, I lost the draft I'd saved through the phone. Please look if the article can be retrieved.",1
"Not only is this THE place to go to find great content quickly, it is also the place to write if you want to stop making excuses on why you have not started writing yet. They could do with some more curation options, but nothing restricts your experience. Edit: Welp, in 2020 the massive paywall definitely restricts your experience. Not only for readers, but also for writing, because there's almost no point in writing on Medium if you want your work to get out there, unless you join the paywall.",1
"How's it possible that after months I can't use landscape mode. Not only for editing, but for reading too. I really don't get how this is not a top priority since day 1. At least for the editor.",1
I interact with Medium in three ways.  1) I read great content 2) I write content 3) I check the stats on the content I have written.   I can only really do #1 with the app. As such from my phone I usually access medium from mobile web instead of the app. If you want to get me into the app more often let me see my stats there and get notified when my posts are recommended.   I will never really write posts on my phone in a serious way so leave that for later.,1
Great site. App...not so much. Would really love to see it support auto-rotate.,1
"Medium offers great opinions on a plethora of topics. Its interface aids easy reading. I like the predictive reading duration, in particular. I do wish the app had an easier way to subscribe to topics of interest or particular contributors. The current search feature isn't very user-friendly.",1
Why isn't this app viewable in landscape for mobile? It's impossible to use the portrait view when you're using a tablet keyboard. I don't know why Medium's app developers didn't realize this.,1
"The app should allow for adjusting reading preferences like font size, dark theme, etc",1
Save article for offline needed,1
"Finally, tags arrived! Still, I miss several formatting and publishing features from the app. Many are mobile only nowadays, so why do I have to switch to my computer just to set the license (and title??) of my newest write-up? It looks nice, really, but it misses the point yet.",1
Can't read people's comments on mobile as I do on desktop.,1
"Having the Home tab filled with ""Medium Staff recommended"" stories is seriously annoying. Should there not be a recommended tab? The Home tab should be for the tags I'm following.",1
On a tablet? Just seems lazy. Should be labeled made for phone.,1
Would love to make use of big screen. Totally important.,1
Gifs are weird in the app and why is there no immersion mode while reading,1
"I'm on a Nexus 4.Please make full screen. Is it possible to add a ""Sort by"" feature?",1
"I have noticed this app eats up a lot data, the app needs optimization when on cellular network. Otherwise it's a fantastic app.",1
Really slow scrolling performance even on high end hardware.,1
"OKish, but the web-based interface is better  This new client looks fancier overall and I really welcome a native app over the previous ""Add to home screen"" from Chrome option.  However, it seems as if the app does not support landscape mode. I have a Nexus 9 that I always use with a keyboard, so this is a ""bit"" annoying.  Also, the composer in the app is suboptimal. You can pretty much use the composer in the web-based version on a tablet without issues and I have been doing that to write pretty long articles. The composer in the Android app is extremely limited, so I do not see myself typing anything in it :-/",1
Does it's job. It would be better if i could save stories to read offline. E.g Reading during a flight or commute where you may not have an internet connection,1
Wish there were categories,1
"Overall, the app is well designed and maintains the simplicity of the desktop version. I would, however like the following features: 1. Ability to edit ones profile  2. Ability to discard a draft. Right now one has to manually delete the full content  3. Option to add multiple drafts. Not sure if this is already there, but couldn't find it.",1
"I have used this app before. Its decent at best but when I am trying to sign in through my google account, I am left with nothing. The screen just blinks and stays. I tried it on different ROMs but the same thing happens. I don't even know how I was able to log in for the first time I downloaded the app. Fix this ASAP or see me abandoning this app forever!",1
"If you are offline, the app is unusable. Which makes it seem like nothing more than a Web view. Also, drafts that I started on the web are not available on the app. However, if you are online and are simply consuming content, the app works perfectly... but so does the website.",1
"Even as a pure reader, this app is still in a lack of several features, two important for me: changing fonts and open shared URL with app. It does what it promises, surely, but still a bit away from great. Looking forward to next version. :)",1
Quick suggestion: Please fix the floating action button. It's got uneven edges and is huge in relation to everything else on the screen.,1
"There is no way to 1) add tags to new stories, 2) add title to new stories and 3) view the list of people you follow. And now I wonder if there is a way to view statistics on the app. Good start but needs added functionality.",1
J'aime la fluidité de l'#Application #android je pense même que je concevrai l'Application #BantuHub a cette image lol ... #Android and #Tab #animations,1
"Ought 2see as also try a different 1 from Q for a change n slip over. Well, but this isn't my cup of tea! The UI is simple. Categorization is good. But there supposed 2be >chance. U put up a barrier from reading not >than 5 articles(?) daily. How wud that suffice any1? O.k. we gotta buy. But the affordability is @large compared 2the subject presented. & we both r @cross-roads 2budge even a little or more, over the present stressdown covid situation! Anyway, 3/5 arts r of exclusive subj n 2good",1
"Whenever my screen turns off, the article I'm currently reading scrolls up somewhere abs I lose my place. Really annoying and discourages me from finishing articles that I would otherwise finish. Also allows me down when reading.",1
Jumped between a few articles. Read a part of one. Then got notified that I reached my monthly limit. Probably read 200 words. The articles appear well written just couldn't find anything I wanted to read.,1
"Very good articles but horrible app.  1 - Photo Zoom with Pan (what's wrong with you guys?!) 2 - Videos cannot play in  full screen 3 - Cannot change font size 4 - Text selection needs extra tap to copy, should be default instead of highlight or respond.",1
"Medium started on the idea of Simplicity. And elegance. The old logo reflected that, the quality this service was committed to provide. However as many here have already commented, the new logo takes it in a different direction.  You could have improved on the old one, like just add a few unique touches so as to differentiate the service from others, but kept the essence of simplicity intact.  The new logo rather takes it in the reverse direction, so I feel it is more suitable as old MS Word logo than Medium's.",1
"I try to read these blog posts, or essays, and I understand that the ideas matter most, but I see too many errors; therefore, the writing suffers. The authors either don't know the grammar rules, or they forget to proofread.",1
"Seems like a good app but I don't want to read about the 2016 election at all. No matter what your preferences are set to,  every few articles are campaign bs. Will definitely try it again in December",1
"Why do you force users to buy membership to unlock articles while we can read on browser in incognito mode for free? In app, it tells that I have already exceed my limit of reading. Opening a post doesn't mean i read all. Sometimes i skip the article after i read the beginning. If there will be a limit, it should be more fair. :/",1
The app is very tricky. You dont really have all the functions of the website available here. I cant figure out how to publish a story in my publication and it just lets me write stories under my personal account.,1
"App keeps crashing, can't read articles. Better to use the browser.",1
I hate that everytime I finish an article and press back button it takes me back all the way to the top of my articles feed. Its is so irritating. Why can't I carry on from the same spot article? Why do I have to scroll all the way to the down once again. Fix it ASAP.,1
"Application GUI is good, but the articles are mostly unreadable and fluff.",1
Can't write articles and posts on the app since the keyboard doesn't show up when working on drafts,1
TO know much from community and breaking news all over.and start job online,1
I don't know why I can't upload an image to my post. This is not work.,1
Why I can't login using facebook or gmail account. I've signed up through the web apps with my gmail. But I just cant sign in using your mobile apps.,1
Great collection of articles.  Some good some funny and many that look like they are straight from The Onion (satire)   Have caution in the truth in the articles.,1
"The app is okay, but the limited stories for a month isn't. Give free access to unlimited stories, instead you can show ads to earn money.",1
Not bad just little bit gibberish some articles,1
"I  enjoyed  reading  articles  from  Medium , the  writers  are  great , but too many  members  only  articles  and I  deleted  the  app",1
Don't want to create yet another account. I'll just use the website.,1
So far I have loved the articles. I am lost into the reading. As an entrepreneur and a reader I love the articles.,1
A great experience ruined by the constant reminder of premium membership,1
Would really love medium to bring the text sliding over image feature,1
Where's your update change list?,1
A bit slow,1
Will give a proper feedback in due course,1

"I love the app everything is perfect. However, I just have one issue, I can't seem to search because it said that I don't have internet when I have a stable connection. Can the devs please fix this problem? I want to have an option to search. 😊",2
"I think the new format is much better. More news worthy including answering the question why which is often overlooked. Less highbrow intellectual material, often difficult to follow and at times rambled, also makes it all more readable.",2
"A terrific source of diverse content, opinion and expression. A pleasure to read and an app that's a pleasure to use. My only caveat is the reader ought to actively search for their own content interest because what's suggested can be a narrow set of themes. Enabling highlighting on articles, saving your favourites and commenting on articles enrich the readers experience. Overall, a welcome staple consumer item in the online landscape.",2
"It's easy to navigate, search and read what we want to read. Exploring topics won't be necessary as Medium provides with great recommendations based on our previous reads and initially-entered preferences. The only issue is that we cannot read comments on our published stories. And such we aren't notified of such comments too. But the overall experience is great.",2
"Many subjects and stories just waiting to be learned. Great way to see each writer having a different viewpoint. There is a vast array of subjects and opinions and the estimated read time feature is very underrated. It expands my view of the world, which is exactly my goal in life. The site could use a little more depth and I think with time and further contributions, it will achieve that. Wasn't sure if I wanted to pay for this service, but at this point, the value is undeniable.",2
Whenever I try to read something...it always pop up the subscription offers. I just like to read an article...😞😞😞,2
"I really do love this app and understand the need to pay for it.... Sort of ! I can't do the trial because Google screwed me slowly out of several hundreds it m of dollars. So I'm not 100% sure how all features work, but as a blogger turned published author, turned publisher, I know they can easily get excellent content for free. Why charge readers when so many bloggers would write for Medium for free? It's not to cover ads - they can easily get ppl to pay to advertise here,",2
The article's title expend to the edge of screen and does not display properly(beta version),2
Love the app but don't know right now the writing is not the same as before. Lots of trivia (ex:numbers way to say blablala) rather than a deep and informative insight,2
"Great app and great content. 1 enhancement I can think about is how to quickly resume where I've left. Sometimes, I got interupt while reading. The app did support to resume the article, but if I mistakenly refresh, the ability is gone. And it's hard to find the article back",2
"I found this app between hot and mild, so full of insights about everything anybody could ever be interested in; for example: just reading as much to learn what is wanted and making sense of it for your own solutions, then start reading . . .",2
"Simple uncluttered UI, stable & yet to break, nice fonts and good page load performance.",2
Medium is a platform which offers it's readers (me) unique articles of interest and knowledge without all the mainstream editing that occurs most commonly today. I give it one less than 5 stars for it's imposed limit of miniscule access unless you are a paid subscriber. Knowledge and information should (in a perfect or at least better than today's world) be shared freely. Advertisements are present which I'm sure receive compensation for. Why not increase those to offset a broader use of access?,2
"I have used Medium from it's inception. Would like to see more focus on improving the social utilities. For example, it takes too many clicks to respond to an article. Also would be nice to have better writing told on the mobile app.",2
"I like medium and I'm happy they have an app. However, the app needs some work. Writing in the app causes words to cut, links cants be added or changed in the same way desktop can, and the bottom options on my samsung note20 remain and causes me mistypes that force me from the app or out of the story/content I'm working on.",2
"Now wirking fine. I don't know what was the issue but after install new updates all working fine.. Not able to create new account, not able to see what am write white text color on white background and after entered correct credentials not able to login...",2
"Overall, a good experience. Too many taps and scrolling and backtracking to read comments. Difficult to keep track of where you are in the comment hierarchy.",2
"I love the app, and the sheer amount of content. I'm docking one star to grab attention to a feature I want. Please include the feature to save articles in lists of your choice instead of just the reading list and archive.",2
"Love the simplicity of the app but I lack settings option for the widget. I'd prefer to see my 'daily reads' rather than tabloid-like recommend picks for me. All in all, highly recommend.",2
"The ""Responses"" interface is way too complex. If you want to see the response to a response to have to go through two new pages, and then go back the same two pages to get to the principal Responses page.",2
"All I have to say is try it out for yourselves. May enlighten some, may be another BuzzFeed for others. Give it a shot and if after a week the algorithm doesn't give you good content then uninstall",2
"Love the app. Allows me to write and see the writing of others. I wish I was able to synthesize my two accounts from two different emails into one account... But overall, it's pretty good.",2
Really enjoy the stories and the accurate descriptions of how much time they take to read. Usually check it everyday.,2
"It a very great app, but very limited as compared to the desktop site. Also it takes a while to refresh its data",2
Good platform to start with. Most of the articles need access to read. Thats the only reason for 4 stars or else easy five for me...,2
It's good and people posts good stuffs in this platform. Positivity in the posts is great. But this is not free at all. Great!!,2
Great app with good content. However the pay-wall is very extreme and it is difficult to find free content once you are done with the 3 story limit,2
"Great app. But offline access could make it greater. Sometimes I just wish I could access my reads offline, when I'm on the train or a plane.",2
"Using medium is a breeze, both on the web and on the app. The interface is user friendly and makes everything super duper easy!",2
It is good to read. More options of graphical UI will be better.,2
Deserves 5 Stars but I believe there's always room for improvement. The cost for subscription can be reviewed.,2
I am not still sure whether this is a paid app or free. Hope it will be a free app as we can help you viewing the ads on this app. And we can also be able to use this app forever.,2
"Good app, nice for keeping up with current DS/ML trends. Only downside is that there is also a lot of low quality content to sift through. But enough good content to keep me subscribed.",2
always well written articles and lots of informative content. i love reading article after article on any subject that I'm in the mood for,2
"Interface is somewhat crowded. Quality articles by writers. Subscription is costly, should be cheaper.",2
This app is abundant in knowledge with a touch of science and reasoning. It's really helpful but the interface should've been more user-friendly.,2
"It is cool to get lot of insights so easily, keep going, it would be great if they increase the number of free stories for a month",2
"I love Medium articles so much. But as a student, I can't afford to become Premium member, so it would be super awesome if you could make it free for students. I'm sure the student community around the globe will be very grateful if you could make that possible.",2
Great articles. Accessible. I'll pay for a subscription sooner than later!,2
I'm enjoying reading voices and ideas that I otherwise might not find.,2
I would love it if you could add the alt text feature to images for higher Google rankings.,2
Pretty great. I just wish there was a fully offline mode.,2
"Have had a great experience going through articles which are thoughtful, insightful and practical",2
Easy to access to articles but sometime it takes long time to load them.,2
this never lets me down. i mean every content has a quality. and now i have started writing too so this app helped me a lot to enhance my writings and thinking.,2
Great app with thoughtful content. Easy to read on the go and bookmark ones u like.,2
Superb platform to obtain knowledge. Gaining insights directly from experts is always fun!,2
Don't like having to subscribe to read again within a month but otherwise lots of great articles on programming!,2
"Thanks Medium team for good user-friendly app , but it maybe needs more options for the specific users such as university or college students as a tool for learning",2
"Love it, easy to use and read.",2
Very best app I read many stories on this app but one problem I can't found my friend profile. But I am publish many stories on this app,2
Every time when I read any thing in this app after few lines it says continue to read farther and the it stops and my mood gets bad please fix this problem.,2
"Loe the content. If you get this, use the 'beta' version once installed. Much more nimble.",2
Excellent app. But subscription cost is too expensive for me.,2
App opening should be made more simple. Asking for email confirmation but not sending any proper link to given email ID should be reassed,2
"Great articles, but as they writers got more audience they change it to monetize and your are limited to great content.",2
Content is delightful. Solid performance. Searching function can improve.,2
"I often find inspiration in medium articles. The ideas and honest expressions of medium writers have helped me resolve inflection points in my life, or get resolve to keep pushing with business or personal challenges. If, like me, you believe there is intrinsic value in introspection and sharing of insights, then get medium!",2
Yeah m quite satisfied because I use mobile so it's better than browsing.,2
Easy and smooth to navigate,2
"Please increase number of free stories. It's amazing platform, though",2
awesome platform to share knowledge and gain knowledge through real experience,2
"""Hell yeahhh !!!""....Gr8 app for sparkin' tips, ideas n guidelines.....very helpful",2
Great! The only problem is I couldn't find a place to comment on the sample I read.,2
Amazing collection of articles! Time well spent.,2
The App is very expensive and free usage short . It should be much cheaper,2
The app is fluid and nice. But some core functionalities are hidden,2
Wonderful articles and amazing perspectives provided by most writers.,2
"Good articles, sometimes lengthy but awesome. 🤝🏾👍🏽",2
"It's great, content was rich and insightful.",2
Im a new user so I'm not familiar with all of the features yet. I am enjoying my ability to get in a quick read on a wide variety of topics.,2
"Great app, I love all the informative blogs.",2
A good guide to those who are tempararily lost.,2
"Medium is OK for me, but I wish it allowed more articles for freebies.",2
"Easy, accessible - not too cluttered.",2
"Excellent app, easy to use and very helpful.",2
Very informative app giving a clear world view on issues.,2
This site has some great reads that are very interesting and informative. Can't wait to read some these books for myself.,2
I wish I could read more than 3 articles a month b4 needing to pay. At least 5,2
"Great App, just published my story with much ease, however I couldn't get the link to my story, how can I share the link to my story",2
Great experience. Especially Audio section,2
I love reading and medium app is really helpful.,2
"Appis great. Lots of creative and insightful articles. But i saw 2 issues overall : 1. First of all, Medium's recomendation engine is awful. It is been 2 months since i keep clapping, discarding and etc. different articles based on my preferences. But every time Ilog into to see daily suggestions, they are some random articles, compiled from my ""interest"". Basically it not custom tailored. If they can fix this, it would be far better than great. 2. I think interest section can have more section.",2
Great reading. Transformative information!,2
"Good app, but few videos are not playing",2
Enjoy the stories and easy access.,2
Interesting read. Lots of it informed and informing posts from thoughtful people.,2
Lots of articles on a wide variety of topics.,2
"I enjoy this app a lot and read something every day. It allows me to connect with writers that I'd otherwise not see. I get ti read a wide range of topics and it has widenned those as I think 'Hey, why not?' and read about something new. My only criticisms are that after initial set up it seems to use it's algorithm instead of your changing preferences. Also its very US-centric. Id like to read more from the wider world.",2
"First, let me say I absolutely adore the articles on medium. My criticism lies in the fact that I seem to have the same articles recommended to me more than once, and sometimes a long time after the first instance. Can't recall if this is through the app or email digests, though. And in the midst of height of the pandemic and things changing super rapidly, I was getting articles that were outdated and had to be sure to check the date. So those things are less than ideal and why I docked 1 star.",2
"Content is amazing, and you can cater it to exactly what your interests are. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is if you don't pay for the app you are limited to how many articles you can read... I wish this app was able to figure out other ways to generate income (e.g. through ads) so it could be used as much as possible when you're ballin on a budget",2
"I love the app so much as it made me improve myself, the thing is, the rates were expensive and not attainable for some people that they as well read some articles for a short span. I wish that the developers would consider the underprivileged people who cannot buy a premium account or weren't able to avail subscription. I could suggest that prolonging the availability to read the articles would be beneficial to all, excluding the idea of decreasing the rates of subscription.",2
"Clearly the app itself is amazing, Providing you with articles just for you ,night mode and a lot more. The problem arises with the content. There is a lot of junk in there.i am a programmer so I speak in that category but the thing is there are not a lot of educational articles that are worth reading... And the fact that I need to really search makes me sad as a user because the service I pay for forces me to do its job (provide content).",2
Amazing Write-Ups :-) .. Amazing App,2
"The reads that pop up on my phone are interesting and although not committed to reading in full feel happy I could at some time. A really provocative one showed today and I was desperate to read, but then it got lost somewhere and I can't find it again, so feel frustrated about that. Good reads but need to focus on how to save them. 2nd Review some time on: I love the diversity of all the many articles that pop up still. So glad I signed up. Feel privileged to have access so thanks Medium 💓",2
"The app is amazing, but please add a google 'tap to search' kind of functionality. Because I love reading these but often I see words I don't understand and leaving the app to search for a word is soo inconvenient. That being said, if you do add this functionality, PLEASE make it a toggle in settings, just in case it impacts performance by being turned ON. Thank you, also $5 i think is a fair price",2
Things writtens are easily understandable by a layman...,2
"One thing, in dark mode, I couldn't notice the difference between links and normal text, I hope you can fix that soon.",2
I have utilized this app yet for browsing and I have already found it cool and handy. Will use it for writing soon and I look foreard to discovering more cool features it offers to readers and writers alike.,2
This is really a user friendly app.It gives me the right recommendations.I Love to use this app,2
Good reading and display some article that's arrange depend on you'r reading history.,2
"Love Medium. The stories are all displayed with header, author, reading time and date. There's a brief summary of each also. Once you start reading (and applauding) stories you get daily suggestions. The one fault I have with it is the constant clicking to read comments. You've to click twice to read comments on comments. It's very annoying and unnecessary. I often find great authors through comments as I share their worldviews or disagree with opinions but enjoy their style of writing.",2
"Its a very good application for writers who can write as good as on this platform compared to pen and paper. Difference is that here writer or author can get a more audience to share. In this platform readers will get a time of whole document by which he can analyse and manage their timings. Here, this platform also provide highlighting tool by which reader can highlight the text which they most like in whole document for which reader have to select. Reader can also give clap to the document.",2
Not sure how and why it is different than millions of news and blog apps,2
"As a UX designer, this app is is a fundamental part of my literary diet. There are some fantastic pieces written from the heart and from experience, and some warped pieces written from confused perspectives or poor experiences. Plenty to read and get the mind cogs whirring. My only comment is that the app is purpose built for hosting user's stories and written explorations, yet there appears to be a lack of language rules in the app which allow orphan and hyphenated words to break the line.",2
Everything is cool except that I can't highlight the text in the phone. Is there a way?,2
Good tech articles for hands on experience,2
"What I always liked about medium is the simple touch it gives when writing, with auto save feature. Sometimes rather than using notepad or word for writing something personal, I'd prefer use Medium because it has some kind of broad, comfy space to let go of my feelings through my writing. Even if I didn't post it. Hehe 😃",2
"This app is one of my favs. I pay for it on a yearly subscription. This might be an Android as I'm also a developer, but if you guys could work on your image loading and gif loading, hopefully even solve the problem for the Android community that'd be amazing. I see gifs on your medium article and need to switch to web bcuz they don't load or render correct or animate. Asking kindly !",2
This is great easy-to-use and handy,2
"The best app for knowledge gain as i am a data science enthusiast i tend to read a lot of research papers or want to learn a more about upcomming tech, great help by medium for combining most of the platforms blog, papers, articles etc. The reason for giving 4 start is that there some articles or blogs which are not up to date and which leads me to google for the same. Thanks for the awesome app, hope u will keep updating the things and providing useful information, interviews etc",2
Everything is very good with this app except 5 free reads. Maybe new users should get 5 and those who sign up could get 10.,2
I am very happy with the insightful and encouraging nature of the articles on medium. I deeply appreciate them. Thanks very much.,2
I wish the app had more free stories per month.,2
"It's an amazing app especially for people who love reading and are just starting a career in writing. However, I'm not giving a five-star because I'm currently having a problem in loading users' info including my own. Please, fix this.",2
The content is really exclusive and rare. It is one stop solution when you your explorer mode is onn in any of the fields.,2
"The best collection/curation of content i am currently consuming. 4 stars because it lacks tagging/folders for the articles saved in the reading list, else it is definitely 5 stars",2
Really enjoy the info and storys.,2
"Great app good content, I'm a played subscriber",2
This app was very useful for content writer's. Readers can get help here for understanding the concepts.,2
The medium is so great and has to make some updates on app because the all messages from the desktop mode to the mobile app is different. Make some updates on app. I hope u make in future u may rectify your problems and a request from the customer how are using the Smart phone.,2
Amazing variety of topics to read,2
"Absolutely there is always thing pushes me to pay attention to it which never lets me regret of reading it. Well what about the rest.. like a new environment for me still need to be discovered.thank you for making that kind of tools which is based on the principles of sharing information, Keep it up.",2
I enjoyed it. I'm only through with one article. That's my reason for a 4 star but I like your app and the interface. It's simple. Only that I've got just about 3 articles for free version.,2
"Way too many posts that you have to pay to read, but the free content is very good.",2
"I love having access to so many interesting articles, right on my phone, but for some reason all the articles from those I follow pop up all at once whenever I open the app instead of alerting me as they become available.",2
"It's an awesome app. For tech gadgets and other gadgets/products, the prices can be added too.. And recommendations of products kinda similar to the product,maybe with a relatively lower price and the comparisons.",2
"I love the way news and topics are presented, clean and neat no noise. Excellent information on various topics, would have given 5 stars but it keeps asking for paid subscription too many times.",2
"Easy to use UI and great looking. Subscription fees a tad bit high for the content, but bearable if you are looking to publish.",2
"There are great articles inside, but you will need to find. Would be more happy if the recommendation algorithm is better.",2
"Doing my first steps in Medium and considering to subscribe, as the content is really interesting. Chapeau!",2
I have always been interested in how to generate substantial income working from home and after reading a few reviews on several different sites I am starting to get excited and ready to get started. The old saying goes you can't teach an old dog new tricks... Well! This dog is slowly learning and understanding . I already have some ideas I'm pondering in my head. Gonna sleep on it and then get a fresh start tomorrow. Thank you for teaching this old dog new tricks.,2
I've only had this app for a little while but I really love how you can personalize your reading! There are also so many topics to choose from when personalizing!,2
Reading experience is good but when i press and hold on a selected text there is no any option of TRANSLATE it would enhance the reading experience further.,2
It is an awesome app and I would to subscribe unfortunately I would like to pay using Mpesa for my monthly subscription but I can't. Please look at that. I am in Kenya. Mesa is the most trusted mode of payment here.,2
Love the content available.,2
Very easy and interesting subjects,2
Love this app! The content is amazing and I love the idea of encouraging freelance writers.,2
"It is a great app to help me read more articles from different people and perspectives. But why can i read just two articles a month, isn't there any other way Medium can monetize without this tactic.",2
Easy to use app. Good layout. Most of the insightful content comes with subscription only. The rest is not time worthy.,2
It's really good to have that much information and knowledge in my hand all the time.,2
"I loved this app, I came across the best content , it has shown to me the various perception of the life. I am sometimes perplexed by the sheer imaginations of authors. Thou shalt install it.",2
Had difficulty while logging in....really strange. But its working now. I occasionally have the same issue on the browser too. Do take a look,2
"Reading articles on medium is enjoyable and also, the plus is i learn a lot.",2
A good app for people who just want to write and not worry about how presentable it is. I like it better than other apps for the simplicity,2
I'd have give y'all 5 stars cause I like this app slot but what's with the membership??? Can't we just read and article without having to pay money???,2
"It is great app. The best part of the app is, no need to search in Google what I want, it always present what I like.",2
"Excellent for reading, not so good for writing",2
Great app but I'd really like to be able to see my article earnings from the app. Also being able to see my publications from the side bar would be nice too.,2
Its really nice ..i like the interface and concepts of Medium to add free content.. Without add everything its easy to read.. thanks for making this app.,2
"I like the content, find it interesting, but hey, I'm only allowed to read 3 articles a month for free...",2
"I never new about Medium before. The very day I came across it, I felt its awesomeness. I really love it.",2
Its a great App that helps me learn and share my insight from my favourite topics. Only if its free version didn't limit me to read 2 topics each month.,2
The content is really good but limited. It would have been better if they would have made it all free and look for other ways to generate money.,2
I cancelled my subscription for some reasons day before yesterday and the due was yesterday but still the money was deducted from my account. Why is this happening?,2
A very good medium where bloggers can write good articles. Lot of technological and science topics as well,2
Very good app for writers but maybe implanting a tutorial of how to utilized the app for beginners like myself would be very helpful,2
Many thought provoking articles,2
Lacks some desktop functionality .,2
"Unique articles on tech, starting businesses, improving self. However, like most media written by young individuals it tends to lean far left on social issues; which can be muted by author.",2
Reading the feedback is cumbersome but the articles are very good.,2
Wasn't clear that this was a paid subscription. But love the concept,2
"Nice app, but could you add the possibility to select text not only inside single paragraph?",2
Great platform to learn,2
Great to use. But hard to find the bookmarks,2
I enjoy this app and have ever since I started using it . Very easy to navigate and never had any problems with it,2
"It's good, but drawback is that without subscription you can't read full article.",2
Comment navigation is horrible both on Android and mobile. I get the feeling that the design is done on purpose to limit comments though,2
Great place for blogging. I just wish we could add pictures between numbering and nested numbering was allowed.,2
Monthly story reading limit annoying and it has very few hindi contents. Otherwise it's nice and I'm enjoying it.,2
"I do like reading the articles, also I was trying to boot myself in the butt to start publishing my own short stories soon through this...Medium!",2
Great articles and personal stories,2
Good articles but I can't change the format of the date from MM/DD to DD/MM.,2
"It's pretty fresh, best thing to read in the morning to give you a boost for the entire day!",2
"I just liked it, thinking of creating content 😃",2
It's pretty nice app for gaining knowledge & a great stage for underground writers to publish their works.,2
Best blog reading application,2
"Great, easy to navigate and good articles",2
I love medium. Best place to spend quality time instead of whatsapp and other social media platform.,2
Good and easy to use .But has some minor bugs.,2
In the last version when I want to see profile it says error loading user and redirect to the home in android app,2
"Would love to subscribe but bit expensive for me, otherwise great concept and app overall.",2
It is sometimes slow,2
"Still getting to know more about this app. But so far, my experience with medium is wowww",2
Very user friendly.,2
It super cool.. very narrative and interestingly good for advices and it got lot of stories too.,2
I think for a student it's really hard to take a membership plans ..... So it's should be free for @20 age of students,2
"I love this app, So many informative articles which open many discussions.",2
Everything is laid out in a manner that is very pleasant to read. Good overall experience.,2
An easy to use app full of articles that inspire thought.,2
"Alot of high quality blog, worth for subsrcibe...",2
Very good app for reading. I started using it and loved it.,2
"Please provide some additional options like highlights in different colours , and provide pen options so we can meke our notes on it for our convenience",2
"Wide-ranging, interesting and often funny articles keep me engaged",2
great app and site but wish I could read more articles in a day.,2
It provides good stuff for your personal growth. I love the app since the moment i downloaded it.,2
"Fantastic reading platform,some blog help me a lot",2
This is a refreshing break from reading the negative or false headlines we seem to have excess of. Some of the articles may have application in your own life..or not,2
Nice app for quick read...,2
Great app but not as close as the website version on a laptop,2
Why did i know this platform at the age of almost 20? I am curious enough about anything. But glad i found it now. I give 4 for now on.,2
"Good, interestingly varied writing.",2
All good but i published my article 20 days back but till now no one reads,2
Delightful reading and quick pick ups while allowing waiting times passing by..,2
Nice app good for continuing reading it helps me a lot in improving my reading skills nd u can choose what u r interested in,2
This is good. And can be used good in learning new things every day,2
"Great experience, I suggest that the widget can also be given a theming option just like the app",2
"I'm newbie, exploring the medium. I like this platform , becoz I can write my views and share my knowledge to others and can published it too at the same time.",2
"Profusion of interesting ideas penned, mostly, by talented creative writers and researchers.",2
I wonder how come they thought of this app... Its like answer to your questions which fly here and there in a stadium of mind,2
Brilliant. Easy to use and varied content,2
The daily report is interesting but is not available in the web version,2
Make more content free to read.,2
Superb App Features. We can also do mobile blogging.,2
"The content is very good, but i encounter an issue while i am searching for any topic, how can i solve this ?",2
"Easy to read, l loads fast, erc. But, it's not a 5 because your clap is not recorded.",2
Great platform to share blog and explore things,2
Very informative app.All advanced code n commands are explained with examply,2
Has very nice articles,2
Good user interface and articles and blogs are awesome,2
Nice application to learn and get news technology,2
This is best ever platform I have accessed. Really appreciate this.,2
"It's good, but mobile app has limited features.",2
Good layout and readability of content,2
I love this app. It's the best so far for writers,2
Its very interested and helpful app.,2
"It would have been better, if I had a guide of which button does what.",2
Very good articles. But the subscription cost is not appropriate for India.,2
"Much information, I love it and I learn many things, and was a good way to learn my English.",2
It is a good app but could always use improvement.,2
"Trump says: ""so now that I have your attention ....this is a very good app, if you think you are addicted to Instagram or tiktok just replace the icons of ""Medium"" with one of those and you will see the results.",2
Good selection of relevant items. Information sings,2
Usefull articals are posted frequently,2
"Nothing to say. It is a testimony of great work and effort. I would like to give my appreciation for creators and most of all, to the developers.",2
Nicely flowing and very readable.,2
Excellent inqusitive Exceptional Research and Vivid Articles on wide Subjects,2
Intelligent and understanding articles,2
Very inspiring and full of thought provoking articles,2
"Can get different views about onething. Guess I got interest in reading.Mainly because most of the writers, expressed things short and crisp",2
Great app but it freezes sometimes.,2
This is really good....you get lot of information and is best for our knowledge built up too!!🤩😁,2
Best place 👌 to quickly get the right information in the right context,2
Promotes reading. A shame that it has to advertise the length of reading time. But this is where America and Americans are now. Sad. I didn't appreciate the free reading cut off either. But I subscribed because I love reading and I'm a Writer. I'm increasingly being turned off by the social media aspect of the comments and responses though and it's encouraged me to NOT want to write any kind of OP-ED ever! I personally want very little to do with social media.,2
Improve on filtering content otherwise great app,2
"It's great, I like that I can write from my phone. But, there's a problem with the editor of the app. The first column with the word ""publish"" is too big and unnecessary, and when I close the keyboard I can't open it again unless I save the draft, go back, and enter again. Apart from that, it's all good ❤️❤️👌",2
Great unfiltered news. Makes to think.,2
Great educational app.. keep you up to date with latest technology,2
A lot of good programming articles,2
"Good aggregator, like the tech section",2
One of the best content apps for heavy-metal readers,2
A very useful and educative app.,2
Usually find something good to read when I want a break.,2
Interesting distraction free reading experience,2
It will be great to have folders for saved readings.,2
"I am new to this application, But so far it is a good source of Information. There are many things you can learn about at this place.",2
Good and responsive App. 👍🏾,2
"The UI is neat and simple to use. However, recently I'm seeing the screen darkening, not due to auto-brightness, once I enter the app. This degrades the UX. It'd be great if this can be improved.",2
Superb place to communicate opinions and facts.,2
"It doesn't give you any idea of what grammar is incorrect in order to publish, smh i may get a subscription, I'll need to look at the the other perks for it though",2
Interesting app with great content allowing us to share our thoughts of things that matters.,2
Nice variety of articles for me.,2
Its pretty good. I can learn almost everything without any cost.,2
"There's something for everybody here. Inspired by stories? Then you will love this. Looking for tips to improve and understand your life? This is for you. Honestly, I find something to stimulate my mind every day.",2
This app is good because easy to use for me,2
It's really interesting and helpfull.,2
I love the app BUT there's some bug i/we wanna get fix ASAP the disappearance of my keypads when I *ACCIDENTLY click the paper rather than the keypads itself the keypads litterally doesn't show up like i gotta press back ang click it again to reapear my keypads :),2
"great, however I am not able to highlight stories using my android device",2
I want to give 5 on 5 but the only reason I don't give is they only allows 3 article free for a month. I understand but still they have to give 5 articles per month. If you want to improve any areas of your life it's best app I have ever came across. If you are avid reader then please buy it's pack to read more. Great application🙏.,2
Great App for Exploring your field of interest,2
Better than what it was when I shared my first review. But there's still need for improvement.,2
"Very nice app! Medium has an odd authentication strategy. You can't just sign in with a username/password. You have to do an inconvenient ritual where they send you an email to that account you only use for signups containing a link that must be clicked. Once you get past that hocus-pocus, the app is easy to use and the content is worth the price of admission.",2
"Honestly, its fantastic. I just love it. It has a tones of different writing topocs to write about. Someeople say it also gives payment but im not sure about it yet but i hope so its true.sometimes there are bugs but im oky with them",2
"Apart from readings one needs to subscribe in order to have access to, Medium is a fine lady.",2
"Great app, awesome experience so far.",2
Very good app lots of articles,2
Worth reading articles.,2
Awewome posts but requires subscription,2
"Great for reading, but I'd like to see my article statistics in the app",2
"Great app to find variety of tech and other articles , well categorized. App runs smoothly and is well organized for mobile usage. I am a big fan of ""time it takes to read"" feature, it's a nice feature , using which one can know how long its gonna take.",2
Great articles! Enjoying it,2
Various topics and it keeps us engaged. Simple to use.,2
Informative and digestible. A pleasure!,2
JUst statting but it has already proven worthy,2
"Hey Medium, I love your app. One suggestion, could y'all add a dictionary to the app. Like when I don't know a word, I don't want to leave the app to go search for the meaning. It like halts the ""flow"" of my reading. An in-app dictionary would be helpful, something like a long press.",2
I like Medium for the concept and the breath of talent it releases worldwide. The reason I don't want to give it 5 stars is that I don't want to link it to the main bank account and would prefer PayPal or another option. Not that I'm sure I'd be paid much if anything. When they're sorted that out I'm in.,2
"As a young Nigerian Writer in love with my craft, Medium App gives me the instant platform to write on the go. While I also surf for more Articles, I don't have to use the internet all the time. I have quick access to best ideas on the planet right at my fingertips. If you ask me that's Awesome!! Ebuka Nwafor",2
Enjoyable articles outside of MSM a little.,2
Remove cap on monthly read articles,2
Medium contains quality contents. But I can't able to read stories without upgrading. Some stories are not worth to pay and read. You know what I mean. So please ask for upgrade only when the story was worth and useful.,2
This is an excellent app for both reading and writing. I will suggest that the creators consider adding other payment method to their writers behind the Medium Patners Program considering Stripe is available in only a few selected countries. I hope they fix this soo. Thanks,2
I have been using this app for a few days. It's more than worth the cost. The featured articles are well written and if you like technology there is no end to what you could learn here.,2
"For some reason momentarily this app doesn't updates your stories frontend, so even though you change the story in the view is still the old one probably left in some cache which aint being reflushed or so... But yeah, so far, medium is totally cool.",2
The app is great with content specific to preferences and also displayed and structured very well. Only issue I have with medium is count of free stories for the month I suggest that maybe you can increase that a bit other than that I just loved it.,2
Really like the programming content!,2
The app needs to be improved. Highlighter should be easy to use and Other tools like underline and marking should be added. Favorite lines from the articles should be easily copied to a separate tab or space within the app.,2
Always good reads.,2
"App is awesome, but there is a bug when you open a link in app. If you press ""Open this type of links in this app"", next time you will try to open a link in Medium, it will go crazy and crash. Please, fix it!",2
"Yes,it's a ads free app.You should go for this.",2
Fantastic media outlet with curated and inspiring works by professionals across numerous domains and industries.,2
Best Reading app,2
"It's a good reader. I'm a really avid reader and I might actually prefer it if Medium had a section for an ""Explore"" category. Might be fun to explore other fun things to read here.",2
Superb website..for young talents,2
"So far I have not experienced any difficulties using the app, I love the way it syncs on all devices. It's a great blogging and reading tool for me.",2
"It felt good until I started encountering a lot of premium articles. They're very annoying. It is very difficult to format articles written by you. The clap feature needs to be placed at a better place. The app is not very convenient for a Mobile phone. It seems impossible to select an an entire article and copy paste it somewhere else. The images aren't properly visible on a mobile phone either. Nevertheless, quality of articles written is very good. Please fix this the interface and user experience. There are some great articles on that in your own forum. Add an introduction to guide users on how to use the app if possible. The articles here are a good alternative to YouTube videos.",2
"Medium holds a flame to the other writing/blog platforms. But would like to see where users can have access to the publication, create, write on the publication. Still Medium is far less blog-esque because how minimalist and professionalism",2
"Good material. If you're going to be reading off a device, long battery-life is your friend. The thoughtfullness of having a battery saver and dark modes on the app is very intuitive.",2
"Great platform for readers, authors and bloggers to reach a mature audience. What bothers me is the paid version does not have many features and clarity on what it is worth. If there were a little more range of prices (available for India), I think it would compel me more to buy a premium one and build my Medium profile, more seriously!",2
"The articles found in Medium is extremely mesmerizing. You will not find anything like you get in Medium. I truly love the app, but after the new update on monthly/yearly fees and limited access to articles, I'm not content. And for most of the students who want to take their creativity and wisdom to the next level from Medium, the new update killed it with disappointment. Some can pay and others cannot. Bring back the original Medium. Not paid Medium. Thank you!",2
"There are so many articles and topics to choose from. The font feels just right for the eye. Each article shows the minutes required to read it, which is very useful and appreciated. Some cons are that that I don't get the suggestion i want, they re based on my previous reads and not on my interests (which i have selected among the ones proposed): maybe i have to look at the settings to fix it. Good exp overall, try it out.",2
"I've been using it for a while; even paid for it at one time, but I think two free reads is too little to get anyone interested. Some opinion articles are very insightful, yet some of them feel like clickbait - a bad thing to have if you have limited articles to read.   UI is intuitive. Has good content. Worth paying if you read a lot.",2
"Medium does everything it needs to. Sharing of stories and recommendations are great. The only problem I have is not being able to find any kind of reading history. Whenever I want to share a particularly good story with friends I can never find the article. I guess for a fleeting medium it does just fine. Still, if be sad trying to be a writer on this platform when old good content is hidden in obscurity.",2
This app gives me the best experience I had never got before. I really love is kind,2
"I find many articles to be informative in the data science area, however the quality of other topic areas can be very poor. I do not think the editors are consistent in a standard that they apply. The app runs smoothly and the bookmarking is a nice feature. I think the subscription cost is high for what it is. I would go to a iTunes like model and charge 0.5$ to $1 per article.",2
Great content. Good app. I wish it was easier to browse topics and interests. It feels a little buried in the navigation. Because of that it's hard to get a wide variety topics read and my feed shows a lot of the same stuff as a consequence. It might be as user problem on my part! But Flipboard is a little more intuitive in that way. Content on Medium is excellent though.,2
It would've been a 5 if not for the premium stories(a majority of them) Shouldn't only the best of the best be premium? Not as many as there are right now?,2
"First of all, Claps for this app👏👏👏👏👏, I have never seen the app with these much rich content, through this app a user or member can dive into the ocean of most intellectual mind of this world (writer). However, one comment I want to add is that, the charges of membership are slightly higher from Indian perspective, as a young man, one should hesitate to subscribe because of the price element. Thank you.",2
Impressive collection of content. Lots of deep thinking available instantly. I like that it indicates how long it will take to read. Easy inspiration.,2
"Interesting. I think, I can learn more things by reading the articles. For now I've read a few.",2
"Fantastic app, does what you need and more. Gave 4 stars, only because I'd like to see headers separating the news categories as I scroll down rather than guess what its category may be. Would be a great addition, it would still be sleek but a bit more efficient to tailor my current interests at the time of opening the app to where I would actually spend more time reading. Thank you!",2
"Worthwhile!!! Articles are informative, educational and useful, life's lessons definitely worth your while. I would recommend the app to anyone because it's not heavy reading since it gives you reading estimated length of time, articles are relatable and simple to comprehend. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I'm a new member and still discovering, other than that it's been a pleasure!",2
"excellent app, but has some annoying features. when you try to remove a bookmark, you often have to remove it twice, once from within the article and once from the reading list. Also, when I click on an email link, it ooens the app,butnot the article I was looking for, meaning i have to search for the article again.",2
"This is a great app in my opinion for reading and responding to articles. So much so that its the first review I've written on the play store. There is this connection you feel woth the author thanks to Medium l, the ui is really good. Through the all, I have learnt a lot from kust reading 2 or 3 articles. But the ""membership"" subscription you need to make is difficult for people like myself who use the app perhaps only 2-6 times a month. There are only so many articles you can read.",2
"I definitely love the way the app works because when you read articles, it's so clean and neat. However, reading only 3 times would be very disappointing for free users. Tho, I understand why—and for the sake of supporting the platform. There are apps like pocket that you can browse unlimited articles even though it has its own set of premium subscription.",2
"Medium has some good (and some not so good articles), and is easy to browse through. The app itself is easy to use, and the only slightly annoying thing I have found is getting my soft android buttons to appear when reading an article. I can normally get them eventually but it never seems easy.",2
"I absolutely love the amount of content and information you can find in this app. All of the articles are high quality and great to read. The ONLY reason it doesn't get 5 starts is because of the article limit each month with a free account. I understand they need some form of revenue, but the limit is a bit low to me, especially given the quality of the articles. Most months I reach that limit within the first few days. Great app and excellent content!",2
I have a paid subscription which isn't expensive. Medium provides access to tons of content. It also provides a new-ish forum for writers to earn money for their work. I don't know how all that works. Recommend at least giving a paid subscription its day in court.,2
"The app is quite user friendly and I really like using it to write my drafts. However, it lacks quite a few features that are offered by its desktop version. Features like adding to publication and providing image citation are not available on it. Would appreciate if the app is upgraded to accommodate these features.",2
"Pretty awesome app. Here some recommendation. I usually read my articles through google curated articles. The issue here is that, when I land on the article, I waste a member preview since it is a premium article. Maybe a way to let the user know when it is going to read a premium article before actually reading it when it comes from outside the app/website may be very useful. Again awesome app!",2
I received an article using a shared link. It doesn't open the article when clicked. It only takes me to the home page and I have had to search the topic again.,2
The app experience mirrors the web experience well. I got annoyed at the push notifications about articles that were paid. I want to choose what articles i spend my free reads on. I'd also like to be warned first that an article is metered so I can choose to save my free impression for an article I choose to view.,2
"it's a great app! i love that we can freely tell what we think from the deep thoughts. but i think it would be better if this app has features to italic, bold, underline words. also, in my phone, i never be able to upload picture. it always failed. i hope you can fix it. overall, great job, guys!",2
"As someone who is seeking more educational and supportive material related to mental health, this app seems to have what I'm looking for. The only thing that I'm not sure of yet is that I need to upgrade to read more - to upgrade I need to pay. Under normal circumstances this would be fine, however being that I'm recently unemployed (not helping my mental state), I can't afford to. Just seems a little disheartening.",2
"I was browsing through the play store just checking out what new apps were just added, and then I stumbled across this app. I honestly enjoy reading so this app was in my recommendation list (along with the kindle app and goodreads) and I have to say, Ive enjoyed reading the articles in this app. You can read articles on just about anything on here. Whatever your interests are, there's a great educational and interesting article that is just waiting to be read.",2
"Makes for very good reading , openjng doors into insight of current and future directions of Humans and possibly civilization itself. these are dangerous and exciting times esoecially with Artificial intelligence and its possible toll on humankind. App itself is designed well and easy to navigate. However the most obvious frustrating thing in enjoying and using this app fully is the restructions placed by Medium itself to garner memebrship and to generate funds.",2
"I really like the clean design approach which easy on the eye, but sometimes a bit confused on the UX and functionality (showing many different sections and categories the more I scroll down). I feel the contents are curated nicely and the category, writer, contributor, read time, etc are great additional info that works well for me.",2
"I think the content that is on medium is top tier! Whether I find them on the app or through searches on the Internet, the articles are concise and informative. This seems to be especially true for computer science and computer development articles. I'm still not sure about the subscription service as I can't decide if it's worth it or if I need it. Until I can decide this I will give 4 stars.",2
"I love almost everything about medium except for this one irritating thing. When I'm reading an article, I have to keep pressing the screen every 15 secs on my phone so that it won't time out. If you can add a feature which can disable the time out while using the app that would be great!",2
"A great alternative for articles in our digital age, and a great way for ""non-writers"" to get their start. Highly recommended. I'm also interested in the evolution of popular information, in terms of the dissemination of unchallenged information, can be vetted in this age of alternative news sources. One reason to always check and triple-check your sources and check your own biases as much as possible.",2
"Like the articles, pretty cool and selective content. The main flaws would be the notifications about similar articles from the same bloggers/writers - I'd love to learn about new articles and authors- and the push to subscribe to the paid version. I guess the paid version is inevitable as there probably isnt much money in ads but I'd appreciate a longer trial period or more options to customize the type of content I get from the app.",2
"I get that the whole point is for people to pay for what they like, and i fully support that. Maybe just allow 5 articles a month rather than three? I didnt read the reviews or anything before downloading. I just read a bit of medium on line and got excited when i saw the app. So i had no idea about the limit until about 2 articles in. So that was kind of a bummer. Otherwise great app!",2
"Great so far. Wish I had the sense of control in telling Medium what I like and don't like. For example if I applaud something and that's used to generate more articles for me, I want to know. Otherwise I want a way to suggest I want more like thst article, I want to feel like I'm helping the system help me.",2
"Excellent platform. The app has been very useful for a writer like me to collaborate with like-minded people. However, for submissions to any publication and for reading the private notes left by others on my story, I still have to go to the desktop version. That is consuming a lot of time. I'm using an Mi phone and the above said options do not show up in the android version.",2
"I have publication and my own account. I like how publication page works. I am hoping for more features. This app is meant for writing more. I had documentation of redesign Lutyensdelhi and i was putting just the project slides on it but the app expects more text than pictures. I like how draft system works. It's a lot in control and gives a nice paper feeling while writing. Pictures size,look looks very good. It looks very well when good pictures are on the blog post with big text.",2
"I love Medium, I love the articles and the special sections. I am giving 4 stars because the other day I saw a super nice feature (maybe a/b test?) where I could select the different sections in a top menu and then I'd see the latest articles published in that section....too bad that it disappeared afterwards :( please bring it back!",2
"I love the articles, they're very straight forward and not over reaching. The only problem I have is that I dont know where to leave a comment, but maybe that's good because comments lead to rediculous egotistic arguments that don't need to be said. That said I actually love the app! A community of intellectual and realistic minds saying things that truly matter.",2
"I love using Medium on my phone. My main usage is reading articles and i love how i can stumble across medium articles in the web and read them in the app. But I have multiple publications and sometimes I write drafts out on my phone. That's the only weakness in this app, the ability to publish easily to other publications could use work.",2
I've had medium membership for a year and a half. I deleted my Facebook account and have transitioned to a much better use of my surfing time through medium which I'm grateful for. The only thing the app could do better is keep more articles downloaded for offline so I always have a few hours of reading when I jump on a flight. Yes I can use the reading list feature but I'd rather this be automatic.,2
A cool app that let's me explore different perspectives,2
"The app is great, but it is using 2GB of data on my device. Why? If the internet is not accessible the app does not work anyway, so I don't see why it stores so much data locally. It would be great to have a.setting so specify how much local storage the app is allowed to use.",2
Enjoyable reading. Not dumbed down as many publications today. Particularly like the breadth of views and the variety of topics: these two set Medium apart from periodicals like The Economist or The Guardian. one technical issue: cannot upgrade subscription from monthly to annual plan without cancelling the monthly plan first. please fix.,2
"This platform has become an essential part of my journey as a writer. It's seamless to write on, publish on and share with my audience. Great platform. I only wished people don't have to sign up to clap or leave comments. It seems a little stressful for those who just want to enjoy other's content.",2
"A beautiful app, with many great reads. But I'm conflicted: While many articles seem to be from objective, rational, and/or scientific perspectives (or just rooted in good secular philosophy - which I like), there's much 'woke' clutter - many toxic perspectives from 'SJ' or grievance culture narratives (e.g. Gabrielle Blair's deranged rant proclaiming men to be solely responsible for unwanted pregnancy...) I'll hold off on subscribing with $$ for now. 4 stars given for what they've gotten right!",2
"The selection of articles is great. Interesting to read, but the 3-article limit is quite strict. Being a student, its not easy to pay the huge subscription fee, so please work on bringing a lower subscription rates for accommodating a wide spectrum of readers. Overall the app is amazing.",2
"A great premium service where you can act as a reader and a writer! I was going for five stars but with the recent update I can't remove something instantly when read, but instead I can only archive it and I don't want to. This UI change gave the reading experience extra uneeded steps. Still a great app!",2
"I've been reading the stories and articles in the app for a month, until I've recently decided to join as a member to fully indulge myself to all these interesting reads! The articles are perfect for light reading indulgence, yet the contents are packed with informative details which we can all appreciate at any time of the day, and they are crafted in such a witty manner; and this somehow entices you to revisit them for a deeper sense of appreciation which I truly enjoy. Kudos to the writers.",2
Very great collection of quality articles. I always enjoy reading this and learn a lot form it. It would be so great if 'ad' version of this app available like most of the apps in play store(free with ads/paid without ads). Many people (including me) doesn't mind seeing ads.It also bring more audience to this app and improve some more people's life.,2
"Nice app. I would have given it five stars but I haven't been able to to filter out the true crime stories. I originally selected true crime as an interest but was disappointed in the quality of the stories. I went into the app and deselected true crime but the stories keep showing up. A minor annoyance. Other than that, I like the app a lot.",2
"I love medium and the app. It's performant, easy to use, and perfect for reading. What I don't understand is why do I only see old (2-3 years) articles in my home page. If I look for topics I'll eventually find the newest articles but I can't seem to find a way on the home page to do so apart from the daily read.",2
"I love how flexible and intuitive the app is regarding the articles I'm recommended to read, but the audio experience is lacking the flexibility that I would expect. There's no way to remove audio articles that I've listened to before or to filter our the topics that are not relevant to me. The audio articles are also not in chronological order either.",2
"As a Computer Science student, this is a handy app to have whenever I want to see what other developers are up to. Fairly straight forward to use. I gave it 4/5, however, because if you want the full extent of the app, you have to pay for it. It's cancel at any time, but still lame.",2
"Solid app, although I have not found a way to refresh and view my own recent article edits without uninstalling/reinstalling it entirely. After editing and re-publishing, the article appears as it did beforehand no matter what I try to get it to refresh. If I am missing something, feel free to point it out. Thanks.",2
I love that I type up stories and I can read stories. A good place to get rid of boredom. I enjoy reading just about everything. Although I'm already past my quota for how many starred stories I can read per a month.(that's pretty easy to do) It's a lovely app and i do suggest you download it.,2
"This looks like a good match for me, but I personally would prefer to have a home page that categorizes the articles into the original topics selected. I prefer to select which category I read next, and to be able to determine how the articles are sorted (chronologically, popularity, source, author).",2
"The ""how to"" section is buried so deeply that I had to answer a post to get someone to email me a link. Otherwise, wonderful service where most authors take great pride in their writing. I look forward to seeing what readings it has suggested for me each day, though I read broadly and thus have a long list!! I wish the site recognised authors from Australia without requiring them to incorporate in the USA to obtain payments for their work.",2
"The app has a problem with loading stuff a bit. Even informs about no connection when other apps work just fine. || Dark Mode is too dark for LCD screens (because those are lit, so blacks are lit from the background, which results with strain eyes after the long read, more than without DarkMode on - one can see letters with 👀 closed for a bit after the long session). Those pitch black elements are just not so good. Graphite in settings is way better || Part 1/2 || For Part2 view my edit history",2
"Pretty good experience, but I find the threads of responses to articles unintuitive and cluttered with distractions for reading more articles. Ironic how many of the articles I am currently reading are about spending less time on the smart phone... Medium has a way to throw endless number of articles at you. Might be time to uninstall...",2
"Great app, but still lacking of support for math writing (latex math) and hacky workaround for pasting code with syntax highlight (you need to use GitHub gists). I ve been using it for some years, and I am a premium member from June last year. I am not giving it 5 stars only because of this. Please add support for math writing and better coding embed with syntax highlight.",2
"hi i love the medium app and use it a lot. but I'm quite disappointed that i can't highlight on the app. highlight is an awesome feature in medium desktop web and since i read most of the time from my phone, not having this feature is a real problem. is there a plan to bring the feature on the app?",2
Medium offers interesting insights by people from various walks of life. But the mobile version is not so good. I have problem clapping for my favourite articles on my phone.,2
"Hi I tried publishing series and got this message. ""Publishing from your account is currently limited due to account newness, incomplete profile, or inactivity. Please complete your profile, and use Medium more to unlock publishing. Any posts or responses have been saved to your draft folder and will be available when you’re able to publish."" I've been using medium for 2 years now...☹️",2
"This app is well designed and it's simple to use. The only downside which I faced is that you have to pay a monthly/annually fees to read unlimited articles, otherwise you'll only be able to read around 5(not sure) articles per month. Being a student it's difficult to pay for these subscriptions.",2
"App is OK. Minor issues with reading lists not syncing sometimes. At least in the filter bubble I managed to navigate into, authors really seem to like using click bait article titles, which I personally find annoying. Make the article title a statement instead of a question and I'll know from that whether I want to read on. Also, lots of authors arriving at the same conclusions about things meaning lots of deja vu with articles.",2
"excellent formatting for easy reading, and the recommended articles are on point. a big community of authors producing original articles. (update) Just learnt that as a Medium subscriber, I can see my reading history in the Reading list. Still I wish there could be mulitple tabs like a browser, marking at where I was before.",2
"App is great, sharing is easy. But i don't feel good reading a lot in it as it's really hard to see and investigate the source of the writing.. I like to know who this person is who's influencing me and who's paying them. If personal websites of the writers would be easily accessible that would help a lot!",2
Have just had a quick look at this the reasons I didn't give the full five 🌟 rating is that the amount of content is initially overwhelming. If I come to terms with this and begin navigating the topics easier than one huge list to scrolls through then I will upgrade to the maximum rating .,2
"I love Medium and the abundance of talented writers there. I enjoy every single article I read. The only issue I have is that I wish we were given qt least 5 artickes per month for nn-paying members. Not that it wouldnt be worth upgrading, it would be more than worth it. Unfortunately, I am enduring an extended time of unemployment and can't afford it right now. So it would be so great uf the article lmit could be increasd a little. Regardless, I love Medium and the talent represented",2
Its an great app.. I downloaded it today and absolutely love it.. I always wanted this kind of app that have both reading and audio section.. And this app really shows the stuffs that matter.. I am giving it 4 star bez its kind of expensive for me.. I wanted to be member but its seems preety expensive. .. I know u guys are worked so hard to made this platfrom.. Really appreciated .. But if possible.. Try to reduce the price so that some of guys also get the membership..,2
"I really like the interface, font and overall design of the app. The content is also great and personalised for me. The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5-star rating is the shear amount of premium articles and the high subscription fee.",2
"Medium is a great app with quality content to read. but i have a suggestion for you guys, there are many words that we don't know the meaning of, being a non native english speaker its some time hard for me to copy the word and put it on dictionary to know the meaning, what if you add an option in the app so when we find a difficult word we can tap on it and know the meaning, synonyms etc. if you do this ill give you 5!",2
"Meduim is great for discovering new talents and knowledge. I love how it strategically analyze and recommend reading list and publications. But I do see, there's still a lot of room to grow. Improvements in the technical side of Meduim is what I can suggest, for now. Overall, it's topnotch!",2
"I love medium but I don't like the recent change to the save and archiving feature. Why add another step by forcing the user to go into archives to remove an article from your list? It was a much smoother process when you could click one button within the article to perform all three functions: save, archive, delete.",2
Nice app with great articles,2
A really great way to get my news and interest fix. I've selected topics that I normally wouldn't read and I'm learning a lot. The writing quality is acceptable and the writers interest in the subjects they are writing about shows their enthusiasm or lack there of.,2
I love medium in so many ways. My only complaint is how glitchy and clunky it is when I discover a Medium article link online in social media apps or other websites and click to read it. The article appears briefly on Medium that disappears and is replaced with the Medium landing page and then crashes. Or best case scenario the article loads BUT does NOT automatically recognize my account and member profile so when I attempt to bookmark the article I get bumped into a login and sign up flow.,2
"I love Medium. I quit social media not long ago (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc) and Medium has filled the void when it comes to finding a quick read. The only difference is the content on Medium is meaningful. Highly recommend the app and I've never regretted becoming a paid subscriber either. It's money well spent.",2
"I love reading Medium stories on this app, but I can't figure out how to comment. I don't know if the app or the site doesn't allow comments, but it's frustrating when an author has made a connection with me through their article and i can't reach back out to them through a comment.",2
"The app has been evolving greatly since the first time I subscribed to it. Love the new daily news feed options. Would exchange the infinite scroll feed for an interest segmentation feed. To avoid bias on this last part, I would have a tab/segment of anti-interest/random posts. Keep up the great work! Ricardo",2
It's a great experience for me to use this app during 2yr. I learn lot of things from some good article. I don't have subscription for premium article so there I have to compromise with that. If you want to read premium article then you have to buy the subscription. Overall this is a great experience.,2
"I like Medium conceptually and believe that it's format is relatively innovative and appropriate to it's stated aims. There are a few points that I wish were a tiny bit different in it's text editor, but that is personal preference. The one thing that I would like to see is a user setting for the degree of similarity of suggested articles with what one has previously read, effectively a threshold for filter bubble effects. Customized content and heightened awareness = win.",2
"The articles are ok, sometimes useful or life changing. Some are much better than others. They're typically low class and sometimes use bad language which tends to wreck the authenticity as honest people don't have to curse and swear to seem authentic. So it gives a sort of cheap, whorish feel to the writing. But if a person can get one life changing thing once in a while, it is time well spent.",2
"Really like the app. Whats missing for me is my reading history. Sometimes I want to get back to something I read and I cant find it. Update: after finding my 'reading list' the issue is partially solved, altough the history is only for 1 month.",2
the application is awesome I love to use it and read all the articles that pop up on my feeds however it is very slow and choppy at times and the sliding transitions on each page either scrolling up or down does not flow properly and gives it a very cheap feel while using the app. besides that reading in the app is fantastic and the overall use is awesome.,2
"This app does a great job of getting you to something you want to read, providing a comfortable reading experience and letting you react and move on. Would be 5 stars but my cherry on top would be a 'read aloud' text to speech button, similar to Pocket.",2
I remember medium when it was rebuilding the blogging platform. It was a hot UI with creative simple UX. The app is great and so is the content but I'm having a hard time grasping the subscription fee. I'll have to come to terms with it one day as consumption can be quite limited without one.,2
"The articles are so good, and the algorithms behind providing the recommendations so well trained. I feel like always reading something or other. Though the no. Of free reads are very less. It would be great if they can be increased.",2
"Medium is like a giant compendium of opinion pieces arranged in an organized topical format. The quality of writing varies considerably but generally of decent quality. In the technology section though, I found articles that read more like product advertisements and perhaps written by shills; fortunately, there's a block feature. Ironically, there a piece in Medium titled, ""Are we Consuming Too Much Information?"" by Oksana Tunikova; something to consider if you gorge on Medium.",2
"Its such a good app. But why does my account @syifanadiaa dissapear? There is no sign of report or anything, and it still seems normal when I open it from the app. But I cant find my account by internet browser, and there is no result when I'm trying to search my name or open my account's link via browser",2
Relevant to the moment. Top two benefits: no Ads and plenty of brain food!,2
An excellent aggregation app that does a great job with the article/blog recommendations and topic focuses. The app is better to use than the browser version. The reason for only originating a 4-start rating is because it lacks group topics for archived articles. Makes it difficult to keep track of like articles and topics.,2
"I have recently started noticing on my Android phone that one cannot bookmark articles from the notification sent by Medium. It was convenient before when I used to directly bookmark from the notification itself, but now I have to go and open the app to bookmark it. Will someone please look into this . It would be of great help:)",2
"Medium is a great platform to write and reach wide range of readers. Publishing through Medium is an easy,hasslefree and delightful experience. One also gets an opportunity to explore a world of new,organic ideas,thoughts,views,opinions,literature and knowledge. If you have something to share Medium is a platform for you to write.",2
"The interface does not really allow me to understand what is available and pick what I want to read. I have read a few very good articles, but I cannot find them again. This may be because I have not subscribed, but I don't think so. It is certainly part of the reason that I have not subscribed. Good content, but...",2
Love the content. I wish organization and search (and saving) was a little more intuitive.,2
"Immediately impressed. The information I've read so far is compelling, well-thought-out, and expertly written. I've only just downloaded the app so I'm not sure if my perspective will change. I gave 4 stars because the only thing I'm not a fan of is the layout. I'm very interested to read more articles and learn more!",2
"Liked the app, but have to resort to using the Medium website for now, as It's very hard to horizontally scroll overflowing code snippets. Even a very slight vertical movement of the finger while horizontally scrolling a code snippet container stops the horizontal scrolling behaviour and initiates a vertical scroll.",2
"I return to this point and modify the rate I gave to the app because the app does not work for my phone (Samsung A80). There is a bug causing the app to tilt intermittently at infinitum... This happens when it's opened from Google app. It really sucks I tried almost everything. The app doesn't improve at all. The only thing that helps is to stop it and launch it individually. But again it starts tilting when opened from other app. Update. It works after the fix, but still no automatic opening",2
It is really a Rich experience to read Medium in android and on web too. It's a site with minimal controls over your blog but that makes a blog very rich looking with their per defined font style and size. It is good for all to have same blog theme. I just like to read here,2
App is good and has got great content. But the recommendation of stories needs to get better and they should add some filter for premium and non premium stories to read. Some articles are definitely not worth reading but still comes with premium tag. They should take care that premium tag goes only for worthy posts.,2
"The only thing I can complain about is when I scroll up the navigation bar pops up and it doesn't go away easily. And it disrupts my reading because I like to read text at the very top of the screen throughout the articles. Other than that, this is a very well designed app and it works flawlessly.",2
Just cool and easy to use,2
"Everything is great if it's not because of some bugs; often, the articles I bookmark don't show up in my reading list. The same goes with the articles I archive. When this issue is resolved, I'll give this app the 5 stars it actually deserves.",2
"Lots of good content, the only drawback I found is inflexibility of push notifications. There appears to be no option to vary or mute sounds so the choice is no notifications or annoying bleeping. This could be an issue with my S10 rather than the app, though.",2
"Medium is an awesome android journal with great updated articles and very cool user interface and experience. It is a great way to read and enjoy news and articles on your preferred topics, and to share your experiences with others in the community. I recommend Medium as a daily read for anyone.",2
"I used this app a week ago. I was satisfied. This app is one of my favorite apps. So, I have been subscribing over 3 months. But, Widget is suddenly abnormal! I can't use widget. This message is ""Problem loading widget"". Please, fix it. My phone's OS is Android 9.",2
"5 stars for content and simplicity of the app. Minus 1 star for a feature that isnt there: the ability to group my bookmarked articles in categories (like Instagram) . I would pay for Medium if this was added to the payed features. -1 star also, because there is no possibility in the app to share feedback..",2
Brings some very interesting reads together,2
I totally love this app but the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because you have to pay for some stories but I understand why.,2
"A magazine for people with special interests, with articles and essays that are informative and stimulating. The only flaw is that some of the pieces they publish are only readable with a paid subscription. Other than that, it's a fine app.",2
"the only thing that keeps me from giving it full 5 is that the clap button are almost unseen when using dark mode. Other than that, all the reading materials are great, the writers know their content so much it keeps them on the hook. always.",2
This is very useful app for reading articles like machine learning. Only thing that I missed in this app is Kami and Diigo like features for highlighting the text while reading. I felt so because in the cell phone most of the time user checks other apps too simultaneously and when you return back to Medium app you feel your lost.. Thanks,2
"I love Medium but the reading list/archive options need some work. When I finish an article from my reading list, I can only move it to the archive and not simply remove it. Then, I need to go into my archive to remove it completely. It's an extra step that's super annoying.",2
"I like the app, definitely some great and interesting content. I just wish there was a popup of some sort before subscription articles open so you don't loose one of 3 free to a miss tap. My cat stepped on my phone and used up all three in about 10 seconds.",2
"a good article in general, they gave topic normal website normally miss as they don't really care to clickbait nor be up to date. reccomend though 2 article per month for the free is very very limited can it at least be 4? i know that you have to make money but i don't think it's asking too much how about for the free user you display ads (i won't even mind the unskippable kind of ads) but the revenue shared equally not per click basis, it still avoid the clickbait right?",2
"This app has some login issues that need to be looked into Edit: Thank you for responding. I ll share the details in mail, basically when i open article links outside this app then it redirects to app but it logs me out. It doesn't let me login through password and even with Google login i need to do login multiple times.",2
"In general is an average good APP. The only thing that annoys me is that I can't copy the link when the desired destination is not within the sharing options. For instance, a facebook group. Other than that, is nice to have it in my phone :)",2
-1 star on the change in automatic dark mode. Really? Battery Saver? On some devices from some manufacturers (*cough* Huawei *cough* Xiaomi) that stuff is to be avoided like the plague because it only causes problems. If you guys decided again that from sunset to sunrise is a better option I'll give 5 stars.,2
"Why am i unable to log in... I've used all accounts possible, app keeps saying sorry try again later. I like the app because i use the web version",2
I really enjoy this app as well as the actual website. I only wish we had the option of categorizing our reading lists and archive. it would be so convenient to be able to group articles into folders so looking for something would be much easier.,2
I'm giving this review on the basis of 5 articles that I've read. The mediumers on the app use a very discriptive writing as well as an easy language for everyone to understand. The app is also quite handy with smooth UI. Keep up the good work.,2
"Great app, but I can't justify paying for it. I understand the developers have bills to pay and they don't want to inundate readers with ads, but there are too many other great sources of well written articles out there for free, so I'm going to have to uninstall this app.",2
"It's a great platform to learn ideas from others, but recently there's a bug which those articles in my reading list have all gone and I am not able to save any article into it anymore since then. This will be an unpleasant experience for the user, please fix this issue as soon as possible. Thanks.",2
"I love medium, read articles from it every day. If images were cached on the app, this would be a 5 star review, I don't always have a bunch of data and to have the app reload images every time I close and reopen the app is a bit if a hassle.",2
Great app for life lessons. It affords its readers the opportunity to connect with others- writers from all works of life.,2
Very well written and thought provoking posts,2
"A really nice app to sift through the vastness of internet archives and present it in an ad-free, minimalist environment. It's like reading a personalized newspaper. Just wish you did not have to pay.",2
"Medium is a fantastic app. Worth every penny. I would like it to recommend me more articles serendipitously based on what I've read before... It seems to focus a bit too much on the same authors. But other than that great work, great user experience. Thanks",2
The app is great sad thing is its not free :(,2
"I found Medium on a magazine and the editor gave it really high ratings. The quality and content are indeed impressive. however, it only gives you ONE MONTH unlimited membership and after that you must pay for monthly fee to keep reading .",2
"I've enjoyed many of the articles/opinions, even if I don't agree with the message presented. A different perspective is always a learning process, it would behoove MANY to take a closer look at their own opinion & widen their thought process.",2
"I love the application. Easiest way to get started publishing your thoughts. However, I hate the new model where almost everything is premium and stared. You can't coarse people into being members by blocking most of the content",2
"Medium itself is great. The app, while visually beautiful, is a bit janky on google pixel. E.g. Scrolling down on articles removes my phone's notification bar. But the whole screen twitches when that happens. Makes me hesitant to scroll up and down.",2
"Great platform for sharing knowledge. But Being a developer , I can say that long stories with more than 15 minutes read time are very slow and effecting performance. It can be solved by using virtualList as in React Native",2
"My only problem with the app is I haven't really gotten a feel of how to navigate my feed. By the time I get the hand of that, my rating will be a solid 5/5. Amazing app with so much knowledge in one place...",2
"I have an annual subscription, and I wish there were a way that my husband & I can both read Medium articles on our respective tablets. I believe a household should be able to share a subscription. I would be giving Medium a 5-star rating, if it weren't for this limitation.",2
"4 stars because of how smooth and good the app is, didn't give it 5 stars because of the insane monthly membership fee of 5$(for a 3rd world country, that's a lot). Non premium members can only read 5 stories per month, which is hilarious in my opinion",2
"I'd describe medium as a quick brain sharpener. A lot of interesting stuff is available for free, but I think most content that would particularly move me, is something you've got to pay for. But a great app!",2
"This is excellent. The approximate time lures me to read, but i find myself doing more research.. I just want to know if these articles are verified though, as these knowledge subtly become life guide or truths to people..",2
"Which there was more free articles, but will upgrade at some as the content is really good. Only complain I have is that you see a lot of similar (I mean very similar) articles on the same subject.",2
"It was really nice being able to read lots of articles by incredible authors. The only thing I would change is the membership. I don't like the idea of having to pay money in order to use the app. Anyways, great app!",2
"Love the app but I wish there was a more in-depth way to organise your archived stories under headings e.g. tech, science, politics etc. Would be far easier to go back to when you want to show a friend or re-read. Hope this gets picked up by the Devs!",2
"My only issue is the content Medium recomends. I'm subscribed to mostly design, data-science, or other technology authors and my suggestions are always 90% self-help/mindfulness articles. It's not a big issue because the app is easy to use.",2
"It's really a great platform for reading really good articles, tutorials based on your interest and It has large number of good writers, Interface is also simple and efficient! If you hadn't tried it once you should.",2
"I love Medium. It has really helped me love reading (and learning) again. If there were an option to save articles to specific lists instead of one single archive (for those of us who love to categorise and tag things), it would get 5 stars.",2
"I'm fairly impressed with this ""Medium"" as a medium for sharing written work. This was the first time using it though that I was prompted to pay (after reading several articles) to keep using it.",2
"it's a very good app, day after day I find more and more articles that's useful to my work , I have issue that every time I opened the app , I need to turn on my VPN to access the app , Please I don't want to do that it's boring circle.",2
"It's a great App. I love the interface particularly. However, I noticed that whenever I make changes to my write ups, it doesn't reflect immediately. Also, I think it'll be nice if there's an option to cancel Highlights we've made. Thanks!",2
"It's a a very good app, the articles are usually informative and well written, very interesting and useful. I only hate that you're limited as to how much you can read without the upgrade, but overall I love this app",2
The app is really good with the content it has. But recent updates to the app has screwed up something. The home page is not loading properly. It will display few news items and when scrolling down it keeps showing loading,2
"Great app. No glitches, everything works. Love the service. My only issue is that the title/thumbnail for the texts are a bit flashy and populated. It makes it a little hard to read sometimes. Apart from that, everything is great!",2
Useful! Should allow unlimited number of articles to be read. Thank you,2
"App itself and the articles are amazing. Every penny worth the subscription. But archiving and removing saved articles is buggy. Also I wish I could write notes without them being public (meaning something other than ""respond""). Thank you!",2
"The app has great articles and you can even contribute through their partnership program and get paid! Reading requires a sub of $5/mth. Else, you be better off not using it. That's why it's 4/5. Requires a sub to fully satisfy.",2
"I like the apps, the design of ux/ui is way classy simple but also elegant and looks sophisticated, perfect place to develop writing skill since there are a lot to read and learn. its just that i wish for medium partner program to be possible adding payment through PayPal, since stripe still not available in my country. Thanks",2
Good clean reader app. Algorithm consistently turns up high quality material to read. Loses a star for not making it easier to move to a story you have bookmarked to read after finishing an article.,2
"Nothing is perfect, but the content on this app is broad enough and we'll written that you'll definitely find something that interests you. Great source for material about AI and machine learning along with philosophy.",2
"Just started Medium. I've enjoyed the articles read so far and found them thoughtfully written, personal and informative. I'll try this app for awhile. A subscription is eventually required for access to more articles. I'll give it a try.",2
"Works seamlessly. However I find it difficult to find/filter stories that match my preferences. Instead of saving stories to a Reading List, I suggest to add categories for them, so I can switch main topics easily. I very often return to particular articles (Android Dev in particular).",2
"Sometime when I scroll down it won't switch to full view, so it's better if there's an option (tap any where in the article) to switch to full screen view. (hiding the status & navigation bars)",2
"Beautifully crafted, loaded with information but I hated it when such beautiful apps are paid!",2
"Great articles by members with out of the box ideas. However, the content is now just going on to become a Self Help site (Or maybe I need to change my preferences?). Nevertheless, I would recommend you give this app a go.",2
I like the layout and the range of readings. But it is annoying how they push the paid version with topics. And you can't find your reading history if you didn't bookmark and article.,2
It's great and I will be happy if I get to read these amazing articles for free... Therefore I gave 4 star otherwise the content deserve rating 5/5,2
I love the app but for me it's annoying when I can not remove directly the saved articles on the reading list. You have to archive it and then remove it. I want to decide from article if I want to remove it or archive it.,2
"Easy to use, font is also easy on the eyes. Only issue, have to press the back button many times to find what I skipped before, and boot have the app ask me if I want to continue reading an article I finished reading awhile back. Overall though, good app.",2
I like the articles published on Medium. The app gives easy access to them. My one criticism is that there appears no mechanism to download and read certain topics offline.,2
Brilliant site for readers,2
"I've been reading articles on the Medium app and I like it. I like the way how it's sharing other people ideas, like a news combined with blogging. I'm actually started to learn developing apps for Android and many articles what I red from other developers was really helpful.",2
There should be an option of grouping our bookmarks as by there categories.,2
"Love the idea, it's just that clapping or archiving feels laggy most of the time.",2
Great experience particularly as there are no ads. Would like to be able to go to Medium rather than always have things suggested to me on my reading history. It makes it all rather narrow after a bit.,2
"Really clean app, nice interface, simple menus. Like how it refers alot of other writers but it would be nice to switch to a following only page or be able to be notified of the latest content from my favorite writers.",2
"Awesome content and have nothing to complain about thd written articles. The audio section lacks some basic features such as a search and content selection. Or if it is there, its not eadily found.",2
"App is having bug in scrolling. It's very annoying. Whenever you change the course of scrolling, a frame pops up. Using the app on POCO phone. Content wise app is awesome. Please fix this scrolling bug. Thanks",2
"A very clean app to a very clean sharing medium (pardon the pun). Only downside, if I link to the app from twitter or another social medium hosting a Medium story, I had to log in again. Probably my security settings.",2
"Such a great app to have. I so much like the ""Listen"" feature where you can hear someone reading the article for you. I also love the contents, its very motivational and inspirational.",2
"The app is quite good. Ofcourse quality content does not come for free, stills the number of articles the app permits to read for free are very less. Still whatever I read ,it is enriching and it is a very good app",2
"I like the tailored content but would appreciate less badgering to read the stuff. if I do read articles, I still get notifications to read it again, which is frustrating. Overall, excellent though!",2
Quick and interesting read.,2
"one of the best websites/apps for journaling or publishing your written material. The only issue is that we can't read most articles unless we subscribe to the membership. Over all, it's worth trying.",2
I love Medium and I enjoy the app. My only suggestion for improvement is to make the save icon visible before the end of the page. Maybe float it in the lower right corner at all times?,2
A good app? The text formatting could be better though in terms of giving alignment options while writing. Also on the screen the font size seemed a tad bit too big and chunky. Perhaps an option to regulate this?,2
"It's my only favourite app for reading very realistic & thought provoking articles. Best source of knowledge from last few years. But paying money is somewhat not possible for me. Please try annual cheap plan for us, fans.",2
"very nice app to read the articles. Imformation is very discriptive ,helpful, and interesting. I use this app when i am free, or travelling. Good to utilize ur time. So many categories to pick. OverAll I Like It👌👍",2
"This was exactly what I was looking for , I only wished that you didn't have to take up a plan to read a few of the good articles. Better yet, it would be great to get an option to not see starred articles.",2
"More than an app rating, Medium is an amazing platform for syndicated and original writing, philosophy, and climate action. My only wish list is that someday I will be able to share Medium articles exclusively with other Medium subscribers.",2
After the first three days I was unable to read stories. Asked me to try a membership. Unable to edit my last story or add pics to a new story,2
"Lots of really interesting and informative articles without all the annoying ads. However, there are some annoying features of the app. I wonder how much the developers actually use it themselves.",2
Lots interesting articles to read,2
"Good app. But, whenever I am sharing my articles on whatsapp, an error is coming up. The articles are not opening on the web browsers through the link created by the app. Please correct this soon.",2
"Good app, easy to use",2
"Good inspirational stories every other day. I am amazed at how the world is so small that we share same problems, sentiments and attachments. I am not sure but I know the writings on the wall hep a bounty of souls. Good platform.",2
"This is not an issue with the app itself, but after using medium for years, it's still confusing how to follow a highlight or response.",2
Smooth and it was great to be able to access for free. Search function can be improved,2
It is a welcome app for those who want to explore different streams of blogs. Facebook and other social networking sites go to garbage infront of this!. This is real social information sharing medium after quora. Great app!,2
"I believe that it is the best site to get started with data science and machine learning and keep oneself updated with the latest tech developments. Just a word of caution, misleading or incorrect articles need to be reviewed from time to time and be removed.",2
"It's an easy to use, free platform for casual writers. My only issue is that they now bombard my inbox with interesting stories I cannot read ( as I am not a subscriber).",2
"I have been using medium for over a year now. Some of the articles written have helped me to overcome a hardship, some have helped change my thought process. Its surprising how many people like to share their experience and do it so well.",2
"Works very good until I want to open a link from Google, it tries to open with the app but a second later opens it with the browse. It might be the time it takes to open it.",2
"Please please please add ability to show more/fewer articles like promoted articles, similar to on website. Would be cool if you could swipe left/right on articles to customize your feed by showing more/fewer similar articles. Thanks",2
"This is a well edited,curated ""e- magazine "". There are many well written articles covering a wide range of topics and many are short reads. No adds..thoughtfull and entertaining.. what more could you want.",2
"Y'ALL DON'T LET ME PUBLISH MORE THAN 2 ARTICLES A DAY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY. Otherwise, I'm in love with the format. It's absolutely beautiful and I've tried varied apps to get some awesome kind of format but this one's just has a home vibe to it. I love the app. Just please please please let me publish more chapters. You see, I have a sort of journal here and I publish not so people read my articles, I only publish for myself. PLEASEEEEE!",2
this is a very good app for those who find good article one thing I would I like to say is add one feature to it(highlight) I am unable to highlight the content I find useful otherwise this app is really awesome👏✊👍,2
"I'm enjoying the articles that are on the Medium website. I'm finding some of them surprising, in a good way. The writing is fun and extremely informative.",2
"Best platform to read everything.about your life goal, Activities,Mindset, and the rest of the day MINDSET is everything.Dude",2
"After a little trouble with registering that cleared swiftly, it's been smooth. Still determining if I want to go Premium or not but I'm not immediately opposed to the concept.",2
I am new here. So far so good. There is much of room for improvement on usage and visuals. Yet this app is a good platform and a treat to writers and readers! Expecting more amazing upgrades! until then worth a 4 star! 😊,2
"I totally like it! Its helpful, but for now I have a lot of things to spend my money on, so I sadly can't read a lot which makes me a little sad, but I guess its no ones fault.",2
"This apps help me to get more information about machine learning and computer vision, and other. And then have good interface for newbie, but this apps need more content, because i always explore many information.",2
"Great app, but sometimes it gets weird to read code, as it fits the text to the page so you don't get full lines of code. But other than that, it's great.",2
"love the articles, hate having to pay for a subscription. the articles are always written from people who know their stuff, and even if I don't agree with the point, it is well-formed.",2
Easy to sign up. Great that they pay their writers and make it easy and affordable to subscribe. A little steep but worth it. Think they should give a time limited free access code instead of an article limit before making you sign up,2
"The app itself is very good, quite comfortable to use. I like the service too, there's a lot of good quality content on various topics, however I do not enjoy the paywall. Would still recommend.",2
Love Medium but the subscription price were expensive for me. Maybe the lower rate of subscription made me consider to subscribe,2
The app is immersive. Loads of blogs from a varied domain keeps a hungry mind occupied..,2
This app takes me to different journal. Even if my intention is to stay on a particular topic I'm able to aware of wide range of fields and the current happenings in those fileds. Really helpful to know things with better perspective.,2
Good content. Would like more insights on world affairs. May be I don't know how to find? Loading a page takes too long. Perticularly when I try to load during breif moments of connectivity in the subway.,2
"This app is great. I have been on Medium to start my own blog from 4 days and I didn't found anything that hassle me. Great work and great app. For every blogger, I would recommend this super app",2
This app gives me lots of articles that is tuned by my interests and makes me read those daily reads without fail. Useful app. it makes me feel I'm atleast not wasting my time with other games.,2
"Comes with all the basic functionality I'd expect. The quality of the articles that are suggested to me is usually mediocre, but there's a really good one from time to time.",2
It is very easy to write and publish my writing. Good character-editing file,2
"It's nice to read well written storeys, the interesting ones that you can select, and that fit on your smartphone screen. Well done. Please keep going. Ronald van Dijk",2
"Medium is like a better version of Quora. It has a clean and sophisticated UI, great content, lesser notifications. Also, the creators play the bigger part by writing some of the best content on the Internet.",2
"Overall app is good, but initially on page where you sign up using google, it takes back to same page again and again, after 3 attempts, app could login using my google account....",2
Kudos for the content. A big thumbs down for the partner program. I am a techie from India wanting to start a blog her on medium but decided not to since there is no payment support for India and many other countries. I think they should do something to rectify this asap.,2
"Love the app. Love the content. Just turn the navigation bar black, across app, in night mode. Really annoying to read with the navigation bar glaring, especially in night mode.",2
Excellent!!!Nice app!!,2
"It's a great app with good stories shared. I wonder if future stories will have tacit knowledge. The know-how-to do things is really important especially for future generations. Otherwise, it's good app motivating me to read.",2
It will be good if the articles will be free. I loved this app but only thing that annoyes me is the paid articles. Please make them free and you will be appreciated even more.,2
"I love the content on Medium. Just one request, kindly increase the number of free articles to 5 per month. Apart from that, it's astonishing.",2
"Great content in general. I would welcome more/better controls on what content I would like, because the range of topics is huge.",2
Unable to use backspace in app while writing. Even certain functions like heading is not visible in the app.,2
My learned preferences in the reading section don't correlate with my audio feed at all. I know there's not as much content in audio but I was expecting some correlation.,2
"Good app. One small bug annoys me slightly though. When I click on a Medium link from the Google app, despite it asking and me selecting to open in the Medium app, it still proceeds to open in my browser.",2
"its flexible, portable and easy to use but it doesnt support my country(Nigeria) in joining the Meduim Partner Program. if it can be fixed that's a 5 star!",2
"Very nice Android app. However, subscription service doesn't work properly. Subscription gets declined on the final step (no problem with the payment method on other services).",2
I absolutely love the content but it sucks how quickly you have to start paying in order to read more. And it's a subscription based upgrade which I don't like. And it's pricey,2
The app is straightforward and works very well. Content of articles is wide-ranging and of great interest. Quality of writing I've read so far is so so.,2
Great reads for curious minds. I love how I can just read about anything in just one place. medium is the best place for both writers and readers!,2
"Great app, attracts very professional journalists. I like that the subscription plan is relatively cheap, but I dislike that you only get three free articles a month on the free plan.",2
Don't give a single article without premium plan.,2
"To me it's excellent. The only minus is that there's no Italian content, nor a way to translate English contents and earn by as a contributor.",2
Thought-provoking articles which can promote new ways of thinking and acting. Medium presents ideas and information which I may never have discovered on my own.,2
"Not a huge fan of the freemium star articles, only five per month allowed, but the interface is clean and easy and the content accumulates well if you're following people and collectives",2
Love Medium! I only wish there was a warning when clicking on member-only articles. I sometimes click on one accidentally and become annoyed at losing a free article for the month on something I was only somewhat or not at all interest in.,2
it's good as far transaction of information is concerned but limited... I mean you have to keep hanging around until pay for complete piece...aww it's worth paying though!,2
Good quick accounts on programming topics. The limit on the number of articles you can read for free is really low and quite frustrating at times.,2
It gives me a lot of information and inspiration i want. Help to get improvement. There's just a lot of reading and perspective. So i enjoyed every single bit.,2
"Topics seems to be informative and useful , but can be checked in detail as new member without upgrading there must be some free trial preriod of atleast one month so that new users may decide wether it is worth or not.",2
"Good technical articles, wish the filter and preferences for content will stop unwanted content",2
This is one of the best applications to share your thoughts. The writers here are really wonderful. Whenever I read something on medium it always and always helps me get better and know better.,2
"the app is simple but effective. The only thing im missing is the audios being grouped by topic. Other than that, perfect",2
"It's great, though i would wish that they added more payment platforms for the partnership. Because the one they are using doesn't support Kenya and other east african countries",2
This is a very nice app. Initially i had some problem verifying my account but now it is working very well,2
its good to have an app like medium. but one thing... you should make all the articles free to read. i know this is not possible quite easily. just a suggestion.,2
Good app. Decent support. They fixed a bug where opening articles externally caused app to glitch out. The app could benefit from having the ability to open multiple articles in tabs though,2
"I love it,I wish they had more editing features and that I can view the stuff that I clapped cause sometimes I want to go back to the article and forgot to bookmark it",2
Finding blogs that are suited and designed for my mental health is a God send. I will be officially having an account with you next month. So much to blog about and it will be fresh reads for the medium community. Kudos.,2
"App looks ain't really that fancy, buh categorization, distinction between stories and design ,all okay.",2
"Good content and ad free discription is the most that i like it,in these ad based app",2
"The articles are really good. Interface is simple and minus distraction. I appreciate the paid membership, though it ends up as almost every article being starred (paid).",2
The app and the web version has certain differences. But the most important is I'm not able to get the functions of a medium publicationusing this app. Please suggest the procedure,2
"Simple reading platform, I wish you got 1 free article a day after a free bingeing signup date to get more people on the platform. However, genuinely love the platform!",2
Cannot open Links from Google. It just crashes. Please fix as soon as possible. Also it's too expensive to upgrade. Edit #1- Thank you for such a prompt reply and fixing the issue,2
"Medium is great for the moment, I follow some writers and enjoy the articles, the effort needed to make a coerant article has stopped trolls of all kinds to target this... medium. But the lack of editors and quality control as anyone popular enough or with enough money can publish may endanger the quality of the output... let's hope it doesn't come to that, as I quitted quora for this reason.",2
Fun. Intuitive. Absorbing.,2
"The bugs are annoying. All in-article links open to a 404 page. When I scroll towards the bottom 20% of an article, it starts hiding/showing the header/footer each time I scroll up and down.",2
"App works well and looks inviting, but metamorphoses covertly into yet another restrictive-access app inviting an annually recurring fee for no-ad unfettered access after you read a few articles.",2
"Love basically everything about it, but the side scrolling when viewing code is very fickle. Vertical scroll very easily overrides any side scrolling, causing side scroll to stop. Takes several attempts to side scroll and view all the code.",2
Great way to read content on medium. Only thing I'd like to see as well is more options that reflect the desktop version (e.g. partner program information).,2
Really nice collection of articles. Would have wanted the limit to expand to at least 5 articles per month. 3 seems a bit too low.,2
"Awesome application. I suggest increasing number of free reads per month. This will eventually increase the premium service sale. One needs to read more to feel: ok, i must buy the premium",2
Very nice app I read it everyday I would have give it 5 star if the fee wasn't so high,2
"A great reading and browsing experience in general, but certain imorovements are needed. -more obvious feed controls -more obvious clap button -pick up where you left off",2
"Cool, but there is no italic, underlined, and bold option in writing page. Need more writing options. But it's cool for reader and a plenty article.",2
"Just a great, intuitive and fun app to use. It is frustrating that I have to pay to read more posts but I understand why that's the case.",2
I found this app very interesting I have been using it for a long time now and it has succeded in changing my life. I have managed to improve myself and also it teaches me new things and keeps me updated,2
"Great for those who want content catered to patterns of thought. You will need to discover new authors to have those thought patterns challenged, but on the whole an excellent place for bite-sized self development.",2
That would be really helpful if this App had option for organizing stories in reading list into custom categories. Everything else is just awesome! Good job!,2
"Pretty good. Has its moments where you experience frustration when attempting to highlight, comment, or edit your own posts.",2
"I am hooked to it.Everything about it is good, except the subscription fee, i hope with time it goes away. The fee reduces it's reach. (From a reader's perspective)",2
Wonderful and very well aritten articles. I wish the app was free or atleast few more articles were free to read. 3 just leaves me wanting more. Keep it up.,2
"Good app, lot of infos go for it",2
"Experience was great, get to know many new things and the idea how to write good articles. Beautiful articles written by Author. Thanks.",2
It's great tool with fantastic blogs. What I would love more to have in it is the ability to save articles under different categories or bookmarks as we have in mordern browsers,2
"It's a great platform for informative learning and exploring different topics and fields. A good medium too, to express views.",2
"I just love the way it makes writing and reading articles user friendly, beginner friendly and look very professional.",2
It is one of the best writing platforms but due to its limited free content it is becoming impossible for students to reach.,2
They've got nice stories that are highly engaging.,2
I love how it delivers top notch articles straight into my Email!,2
"This app is a house for learners. It publishes wisely, a wide range of topics. Although articles contain grammatical errors, but still altogether its a thumbs up app for people who like to read at length.",2
"Really love the app and the content, but having to pay $5/month after reading 3 or 4 articles per month is pretty steep. I'll continue using incognito mode TYVM.",2
"A really good app, if you like to read blogs. And on a side note the dark theme is just awesome..",2
"Reliable app for a website with great content. Helpful reading list function to keep articles for later. Would be helpful to search your own archive with more criteria, eg. number of clasps you have the article.",2
The atricles on programming and design are really excelent quality. It's a shame that there's a membership you have to buy to access 95% of the articles.,2
Great content and article management. The limitation on how many articles can actually be read is a bit of a turn off.,2
"a Beautiful experience readin articles in a wide community.. makes uu close to people who share the same passion as uurs, so u can invest nd fig deeper on that.. at d same time allow uu to explore new things tht u might be intresting in.. yet it a bit annoying to have a limited & restricted privileges less than a disconnected person.. like i can't read and article, while i can doo that if I am not a user at all",2
Interesting articles on many subjects. While many of the political writers tend to be liberal you do get some alternative ideas.,2
"Love the content, the app is pretty great! There are some small features I miss from the web app, but what is present works just fine for me.",2
"great articles, superb layout. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to load. very heavy on apps.",2
"I have been especially pleased with the materials presented. Its accessable, timely, deeply interesting and informative.",2
"The articles are thought-provoking, which is why i absolutely enjoy reading them. The topics and themes are numerous, which expands my thinking and horizon.",2
I really enjoy reading on Medium. I'd love it even more if I could easily identify ALL articles from an author.,2
"App and content is great, but day by day all content is going for premium. Open to read quality content is getting less.",2
The Medium App is really an educative app where well thought out and inspiring stories are shared. I love how simple and easy to read the user interface is .,2
this app is very interesting and it helps you get jobs and opportunities to have a better life and a better career where you could do surveys with with other companies and they will get if you do good and well they will pay you a good financial amount of money every month it's a very good at I love it thank you and have a wonderful day if they don't then you're just doing it as a good well-being of a good Lord and and I bless you for all in Jesus name amen,2
2nd day into this app and I think I need a monetary subscription. Dude why. The articles are really good. But I'm a college student and I'd like to read for free. I understand that people invest their precious time and they have to make a living out of it. I just wish I could read for free.,2
I love when I stumble on some really well written articles. Some articles are like someone's garbage that they found the opportunity to share with people. I wish Medium has a moderation system to prune those.,2
Hi :) I'm not receiving a verification email and I've tried several times. Is it only compatible with Gmail addresses? 🤔 Because I have been trying to use a Hotmail one. Please help. 😞,2
"great stories, notifications are about once a day, and the layout is appealing and easy to navigate",2
"I haven't been able to do instacart fow a little bit.. and want to start back up. I'm trying to figure out all the new ways to receive batches. I hope, being I have not done it for long.. I can figure this all out.. lots of new information.",2
"love the articles, very informative and assist with my understanding of development and the tools that are used.",2
"Nice offering, although some articles that count towards the 5 free a month can be read completely free on their original platform... Medium, you could at least not count those articles against my 5 free....",2
Simple app with no distractions. Tons of good articles. Must have for people who prefer reading just about everything.,2
"Just lacks in curating features, bookmarks exist but I would like a way to organize top selections in each section and reccomend articles and authors and generate a profile off of that",2
Nice UI. Difficult to navigate between posts. There is no swipe right option as in your iOS version. it would be great if you can bring that feature.,2
Nice app. 2 notes: 1. A black theme choice would be great! (Or yellow-y) 2. It would be great if you could store articles in separate lists for later reading,2
"Browsing, reading are good, but while commenting sometimes keyboard malfunction in the android app. Please fix it, and I would be eager to give you 5 star rating.",2
"Very useful in plethora of fields, please add dark mode to your website, it's hard for writers to star at white screen such a long time.",2
Excellent app. But they keep asking you to sign to to premium. I have only been able to read one article. Sayin that though the app is amazing!!,2
I love it. Very simple to access and I love the white background except at night. But I'm having difficulty sharing the link from the app. Why!?,2
Majority of articles are well thought out and worth reading... would be nice to leave politics out of non-politically oriented topics but I guess those are the waters we swim in these days.,2
This app is great although there seems to be a weird bug that happens when you receive a notification. The app immediately scrolls up and you lose you place. Otherwise clean app.,2
I love the app in wholesome but its article relevance checking is a bit dull.,2
"I love Medium articles a LOT, but I don't knoq why everything coming from its site url not working, thus all images don't appear. Is it blocked for some countries? I am from Egypt, btw.",2
"The app is good and the articles are great, but you can only read few articles per month else need to subscribe to read more.",2
A recent update has made it impossible for already published articles to be edited on android. a very big problem that has to be fixed.,2
"Pay for reading more, the app is very useful, but the screen design is not quite convenient for choosing topics.",2
its cool but would have been better if i could post on my publications through the app. also i wasn't able to see the list of publications that have added me as a writer...had to open medium in browser for that,2
It crash in feb 2020. I had to remove and install again. Now it's all good. Love the night mode and font change. Ease my eyes significantly.,2
"Great app, wonderful articles. Just wish the 3 a month thing wasn't a thing, but I understand it.",2
Only 3 articles per month in the free version is a joke! the application itself is great and has good content.,2
This app helps me to discover knowledge. I don't have any problem using Medium up until now I write this review. Thank you,2
"love the app, but there's something missing, there's should be marker for long threads/stories, so it's easier to continue reading",2
I really love it. It exhumes my creativity.,2
"The app and content are great, but it is just another way to be hooked to my phone like a lifeless drone.",2
great app to have quick reads on. it would be better if it's more than 3 articles per month for free members though!,2
It is a really good app. But it would be better if there is more change to read some starred stories instead of three.,2
It is a great app. But the previous version switch topic division was much better than the current one.,2
I am new to this app. So far I am loving it. Very nice.,2
"I really like Medium, but I'm not ready to pay for it. I wish I could filter off the premium member-only articles for a while until I'm ready to become a paid member. I don't see any way to do that.",2
Include printing of articles to pdf for offline reading purpose.,2
Great platform. The only reason for 4 stars is I want an option to be able to listen any article I like.,2
Love this app. Only thing that would make it a go to for me is if it would cache the articles down for offline reading.,2
Good. Opens quickly. Easy to read fonts. Easy navigation. Will use again soon.,2
Reallu great app if you are like always in search about something new to read or a place to publish. Great value for so little.,2
"I enjoy it, great range of topics easy to find what I want, I can save articles for later.",2
Regular part of my daily reading. A high quality of writing generally though articles driven by political bias or product advertorial should be marked as such!,2
"its only one things make anoying, when clicked the link on web to open app, instead of open the app and show up the article, it doesn not, redirect me to store, wrong flow",2
Brilliant! Productive and time efficient. Focused articles with estimated time required to complete the reading.,2
Two issues: - Suddenly I can swipe left on reading list items to. bookmark. - Wasn't able to easily edit comments in the app.,2
"I prefer grey for text in dark mode. Or a function of making up the UI. Anyway, thanks for a good page.",2
I love the way articles are presented. For bloggers and designers like us we don't need to think too much for the presentation. Too good and simple to use.,2
"Fine but in dark kode many things and sections appear to be mixed up, a little bit od UI change can do",2
"I like the app, but could be better if the articles only available for subscription had a label, mark, text or something to differentiate",2
Love reading the articles that's for what I love and what I'm focused on in my own personal life. Need some motivation this app and Medium will get you in the right mindset.,2
"Good app, though why is it using almost 1gb? Also it's frustrating to keep being notified that I can use the save feature... which I use frequently.",2
It's great so far (I've just downloaded it). The only problem I've had is that it says it can't be downloaded at this time even though it's already downloaded.,2
I love Medium so much I payed for the yearly subscription! Most articles are very well written and interesting.,2
"Excellent Content, Presentation,Simple, Straight language easy to follow. High Class of updation of subject matter from Experts of repute.",2
Truly enticing articles .would have rated 5start if a free version would be available. Kindly try to make a free version though without much privileges,2
"If you can tailor your interest right, you get high quality articles in your field of interest. Tailoring your feed takes a bit of work but staying both interested and informed in your field is worth it.",2
"Awesome, informative very interesting covering a range of topics I would not have thought of. Excellent reading and rewarding!",2
Seems on form from What I can see atm but then I observed few suspect posible issues yet to be tested and tried in the first glance tho I found it to be very easy to.use and ran sufficiently.,2
"Well integrated with email newsletter, nice dark theme and general readability. 4/5 because images sometimes are not scaled correctly for phone screens.",2
"Came accross couple of bugs on the app, but overall its okay. Like it more than reading on the web on mobile.",2
Extremely useful and informative. Such interesting information should be shared widely and should not be limited by number or money. Anyway I appreciate your efforts in the direction of the sharing of knowledge.,2
"Just started using Medium app, I'm fascinated with articles in nearly every discipline of life and I think this is the right place.",2
Love the content. Would love to see a way to categorize bookmarks. Overall great experience,2
Best experience for members. Although there is a serious need for the filter on stories which are member only and which are free stories.,2
it an awesome place with so much info. i thought it's free but most times you get restricted in some post asking you to upgrade with money.,2
Best content available for knowledge gain and improvement. 4 stars because just articles per month is too less.,2
"Great articles which are not found in the main stream media like news papers, magazines.",2
"Love the blogs here, started reading Broken and healed with Stroke at 38. New to the site but will be visiting often in the future.",2
Great content but other authors should comment on articles to better eveluate content,2
"Really great, one thing is the text of articles sometimes overflows off the screen in portrait mode",2
it's very a good app and very light. but please somehow I find it font size and spacing is a bit unconvinient and I believe it can be improved,2
Love the content. I find it very useful and it opens my mind to various subjects I never really thought about.,2
I liked the neat and minimalistic design of this app. And the information is great and to the point.,2
Unmatched interface with great content. But it frustrates me how most of the articles are now paid.,2
The only way this could get better is if there were an option to listen to the articles being read!! So many awesome things to read on here,2
"This app is for people ( like myself) who have a yearly subscription to read on the move. if you don't have one, then no need to download.",2
"A bunch of interesting articles, very well written...the UI could use a mock-up (personal opinion)",2
its a lovely app. I've noticed that i cant select all the paragraphs at the same time.,2
As a whole I prefer Medium - for reading and writing - simply due to the ease of access.,2
The interface is good but problematic if you are a contributor and attempting to manage Medium in conjunction with other social media.,2
Great experience and daily read is a fabulous initiative . I would be nice if the blog can suggest or redirect to refered books or blogs directly to decrease browsing time.,2
$5 for subscription seems a bit much while there is so much content available for free on the internet. Otherwise all good.,2
I do like medium but new logo is hedious and annoying to look at lolz,2
"Excellent for all kinds of news, blogs n many more, these helps me to communicate those people's who has a vast curated skills etc.",2
"Articles tailored to your interests, well-written and relevant. My experience so far has been great.",2
"I find that most of the articles are well written and quite interesting. I enjoy learning new things, and I am not disappointed with Medium.",2
"Along with dark mode and light mode, for a reading app it'd be nice if you add a blue light filter mode! I'll rate 5 stars when that happen.",2
Great articles and great recommendations. One important feature I missing is the ability to find a word or phrase in text in a specific article,2
"I love the app, and the articles are entertaining and well-written. But the cost of the subscription!",2
"I enjoy Medium and started subscribing to start writing. I haven't started publishing on Medium yet, but I thoroughly enjoy reading on it.",2
Very informative. my only wish is that there would be more than 2 free reads per month.,2
"I love this app. The style, how it suggests and stuff. But I feel sad that I must get premium to read more articles.",2
"App is good, but willing to see more improvements in future. Thankful to medium for supporting newbie writers like us.",2
"As a starter using the app, I got familiar with the interface fast. My rating might improve if the app ends up meeting my expectations. Anyways it's fresh",2
"Quick, simple and clean, good looking and minimal, supports dark theme, what's not to love? Well it's the maximum articles of course but that's understandable to an extent",2
"Nice app, but it would be better if it was just free. I think everyone tolerate ads if the content is worth them.",2
Nice app with articles. I don't use it as intended I think: I mostly use the app to open articles that I find in external resources.,2
Absolutely love it that the content is just few minutes read and worth it. For longer reads I like physical books.,2
Beautiful app. Just that it's paid subscription post only 4 articles. There's so much to read on it but not for free sadly :(,2
"An endless variety of fascinating, immersive articles about anything you could possibly think of.",2
"Better than I thought, although a lot of really safe writing. The word equiv of applying photo filters.",2
"Good to know finally Medium can save from external link as well, and made me decide to subscribe premium offer. But wondering could you add Tag/Folder/Collection capability for us to manage the saved content? It must be help user in finding historical content based on the certain topic.",2
Very useful in gaining insights on a wide range of topics! Lovely interface.,2
"A platform for readers and writers, which bridge the gap between good content creators and the content seekers of diverse test.",2
Excellent app! I particularly enjoy the varied opinions and insights from the writers on the platform.,2
"It's a good apps that updates me, in fact I was shocked, that what i was reading concerning the importance of good sleep was also a current news casted on TV.",2
"Pretty great. Just wish that it was clearer what articles you can read limited amounts of, and which are unlimited.",2
It's pretty good if you love to know about stuffs.,2
Great stories and varied content. I just wish I could read more without having to subscribe.,2
"nice looking UI with but provides poor features such as ""save to reading list"" which are no better than a browser view of each article",2
"It would be great if one, as a reader, had more reading quota a month.",2
This is a good app for reading content. Easy to use and works well for finding your favorite article in a pretty large pile.,2
just hangs showing me the stupid tree growing out brain pic when i clicl from email how hard can this app be its like a html reader good content but usless app fixed improved star rating you recommendation engine drifts quickly :) see if you can impelement better ways to control it,2
"great valuable, practical and fun content that's educational and inspiring. although very easy to just consume because there's a wealth of stuff to follow from entrepreneurs to therapists.",2
Almost perfect app! Just add bin for deleted stories which you want to recover! Also support for GIFS and videos would be really helpful!,2
"A good simple reader but ultimately, like all things, it can be improved.",2
"Four stars for the totality of Medium, not just the Android app. I have a problem with the editing platform. Fix that and I'll start handing out five star reviews.",2
"I'm very excited to read more, but can't currently afford to upgrade. Hope to someday, thank you for a great app.",2
Good range of topics,2
Great posts. they should add more on the free membership. all in all I like it,2
Great set of articles tailored to my interests but lacking the ability to zoom in is quite challenging for properly viewing some code snippets,2
Good short filtered read with only interested topics. Happy reading 📚,2
Many articles are full of insight. It will be good to add readers' reaction and response to what they have read.,2
It's a great app with quality content. Works smooth and fast. The only thing i dislike i that the free articles are less.,2
I appreciate the recommendations but want them to be broader in focus. Is there a place in profiles etc. to set a wider range of preferences?,2
The reading is easy. It's very clear text. I'm frustrated by not being able to clap for stories.,2
It gives access to well-written and well-researched articles. Plus provides an advantage to those on the go.,2
"Medium has become my day to day app. Been reading, learning things and applying them to my work from Medium. Too much helpful.",2
"The only thing I don't like about it is that there's no way to remove claps, if I accidentally click on it while scrolling.",2
Very good content and app design. My only complaint is the recommended stories; they're almost never relevant to me.,2
"Great articles, good reads. Would be a 5* if it allowed you to read offline bookmarked articles on the free app.",2
"It started with ""There's only one thing to do with today:Seize It"" and now I'm hooked! Great writers and inspiring reads!",2
It's cool but after a short time you gotta pay. And I understand but still it could've be a really cool app..,2
That's an awesome experience to use the knowledge base like medium :) plethora of things to learn from. The best guide,2
"I enjoy reading the articles I find here. On the creator side, I would love to have the ability to make writing more visible.",2
If I would have the option of giving 100 stars. I would have given 101 🌟 to Medium. It is the best app and virtual Mega magazine for every computer lovers be it software data science ML or AI. I am now a proud Medium paid subscriber. And after my first subscription I am now fully sure to continue through out my career ahead to stay most relevant in Industry.,2
"I love Medium and the way it's curated. As a writer, I only started reading the articles to get diversified views about a number of subjects. And thus far it's been great. I regularly respond to posts and I've even found a mentor through the platform. My daily habit is to read two or more articles on Medium and ruminate on them. Thanks for the stellar usability as well.",2
"Clean app, I love it but I liked the previous icon of the app. I don't have any problem with the design of the icon but I prefer smaller dimension of the icon, like the previous one, It makes it more appealing. Keep the design of icon same, but please reduce the dimension of this icon..it might be a strange suggestion but I love it that way. (¬_¬)",2
"A wonderful collection of stories and real life experiences across different genre. U can pick and chose the authors, publications, topics that best suits ur mindset. Very informative and easy accessibility across different topics and write ups.",2
"Huge fan of the Medium app. I spend hours reading content, and have never had any major issues with the app.",2
"I love this app as a platform to learn new thing through new media a part from other resources like Wordpress, Tumblr, Pintrest, and so on. 😍😍😍",2
"One of the best apps I have come across. Such wide variety of read and an amazing collection of info, from serious to trivial. Just loving it👌👍",2
Worth the measly $5/month cost. This app is way better than reading (or listening) to published books. Invest in yourself and get this app if you’re ready to make the big leap into perpetual self-improvement. Thank me when you become wildly successful.,2
I like the 5-6 minute reads. Short reads are what I have time for. I can explore quite a bit in small bites.,2
"With stories that range from whodunit to solved cold cases to many interesting genres, Medium offers a wide range from excellent authors.",2
"Great app. Nice features. I love the data science articles and tips for python programming. There are a ton of other categories of interest but be aware that Medium is not a peer review journal. That being said, consider the topic you are reading about and if it's something you can test or just for entertainment Medium is awesome.",2
"Lots of great articles - I always find an interesting read, I always look forward to my daily 'suggested stories' and the ability to 'disable image loading' is fantastic when trying to look for an article without any bias towards a photo, which may have nothing to do with the article at all. Love the app overall.",2
"Relevant articles and awesome subscriptions recommendations, all I ever want and more, I love the app 😍👌",2
Awesome app! Enjoying the 'Short Story' experience through the discovery of some exceptionally talented writers. Their vulnerability and creative styles truly capture the essence of 'One's Journeys' throughout their lifespan illustrating both heart felt (shedding a silent tear) and humourous (shedding of happy tears) emotions. 'The man who never wore shoes' by Kristy Bertenshaw is a classic example. Thank you 'Medium' Aptly named for an Exceptional App!,2
"I am interested anything that has mathematics in it. I am trained in Statistics. However, I try to understand topics in mathematics to a possible extend. I find articles on various topics related to mathematics are written in a simple way so that any interested person can understand with minimal effort. Thank you",2
Love the short stories or messages that are readable within 5 minutes providing a quick look into another's thoughts.,2
One of the best app which I come across with the great content.. it's very fast & smooth functioning.. Hope will get good updates..,2
"I found the app through a blog. Now I am using it. It's so good that I once start reading l can't stop. The User Interference is so good and feels smooth. Lots of articles are there to read regarding many aspects of society,life,environment etc.",2
"Medium is one of the best site for bloggers who want to post their work for free. It's easy to use, user-friendly and amazing. I have recently started blogging on Medium to post my samples for freelancing online and I'm quite loving it just because of Medium. However I hope Medium does something to increase web trafficking for new bloggers and blog posts instead of ones that are already quite famous.",2
Interface is really easy to use and I love the aesthetic that Medium has. The way Medium organizes their stories makes it easy to find what you want to read while at the same time giving you things that help you gain a new perspective. I also really appreciate that they have a dark mode setting.,2
Very informative app And easy to navigate once you've picked your areas of interest👏,2
Great medium zone that captures all zones! Keep it up! Will be following your news!,2
"Sometimes there are times when I just don't want to make an effort to search the web to get the help, knowledge and support I want. Medium is a great platform. I have a broad range of topics to choose from and most of the writers write exceptionally well with content that actually makes sense... :)",2
"I quit my job in 2018 to write on Medium full-time. People criticize the paid membership, but if you like reading the stories, you should want to see the writers get paid for their work. I almost exclusively work from the app and find it to be very intuitive and easy to use. Occasionally, Medium has some bugs that also impact the app, but those issues are not on a large enough scale to cloud my experience. It's the one app I use daily.",2
Medium has become my new go-to for articles on JavaScript and VSCode. Medium's format is short week written articles and most of them are accessible and not written for experienced programmers. I've never understood why tutorials are written with such advanced terminology that you can't even use them. Don't seem to get that same thing on Medium.,2
"I'm not much of a reader but when this site came up it caught my eye, and I automatically started reading the articles. I like them because they're short but they get to the point and tell you what you need to know. The first one intrigued me so much that I opened a second one, and then our third. I thank you for allowing me to do so, I find Medium very knowledgeable, Kathleen Byrd",2
Read what you need on the go. No more scrolling through 100's of emails to find important information you think you remembered from last week ... Well written informative articles are easily accessed when and where you want to read on this simple interactive and intuitive app.,2
"I love the app, but honestly the new logo is so bad, still you got the 5 stars, you lost your original touch i think with this logo",2
Every day I read thoughtful and stimulating articles! Can't imagine not having it.,2
Best platform for bloggers. For Affiliate markers rules are very strict.,2
"Great app for news and stuff. Some ubiquuitous thing that's becoming ubiquitous amongs app these days. Basically, they spam you to rate the app. I see that as fundamentals.",2
Great quick and simple reading layouts. Dark mode increases this readability by folds. I want everything I read or even write out myself to be this neat and enjoyable to read in its simpliness. Business documents could truly learn from this.,2
"An eclectic mix of writing, some professional , some interesting and others absorbing in their content. All in all, I am enjoying the app along with the writing too. I should probably read more. Personally I am very happy to pay for the content.",2
Today was my first time using app. I enjoy the set up and lay out. I like that approximate read times are given. I do enjoy quick reads on many different topics. So far so good for me.,2
"I consider Medium the perfect platform to read about almost anything you can imagine, you can also find persons and content creators with similar mindsets and yours and learn from them. The app on Android is really well made, I enjoy it's UI and love the dark mode.",2
"I like being able to read (great) media on topics I'd otherwise wouldn't be able to find on my own. It's a breathe of fresh air from social media posts, gurus and heavily opinionated news websites. This is something truly great.",2
"Promoting long reads, with beautifully readable design. Thank you.",2
"I'm always hungry for something to read. I have very specific interests so other articles fall short when it comes to what I want to read. With Medium, each day, I'm able to read new articles on things that fascinate me and, also, give me the opportunity to have my voice heard too.",2
The Authors are fantastic. Talented each one takes you on a journey .,2
Loveee medium since several years ago. The articles is so entertaining yet educated. One of my resources to search and dig into anything that comes in my mind.,2
"This app is worth using your time on it. It helps with a lot stuff. You can read articles and stuff you wanna and it is pretty productive and is so useful. In addition to this,you can publish stuff too which improves you much.",2
"There is so much great stuff about Data Science, Business, Tech and Personal Grooming in here that it's hard to choose what to read and what to mark for reading later. It's like being overwhelmed in your dream library.",2
"A particular writer always grabbed my attention. An eventually i decided to read more from them. Thus, i downloaded this app. And honestly, the interface of this app is simple and elegant. I love it.",2
"Medium is a place where i love to be to expand my knowledge but i have to say it the android app is trash, i am a Samsung Galaxy note 4 user and the keeps crashing all the time i wanna read an article and this has being going on for months now, at first i thaught it was because i was not a medium member but now i am and it still continues crashing each time i open an article from a link or when i want to read one in the app itself ---------- Finally with the new updates, the bug got solved 🖒",2
The reading content is really interesting and platform too is pretty good . I have not subscribed yet but I happily read my free reads ! Infact I love reading ! Not subscribed just coz don't have enough time ! Thanks a lot Medium for creating this platform !,2
"Awesome stories, amazing interface. Thats all you need. And the developers nailed it. I started reading and just got hooked. The selection of articles is just amazing keep it up ! 👍👍👍",2
"Good writing platform for sharing with peers and the public. More than a blogging platform, it's a place for creating and admiration for your fellow writers who are so talented.",2
"Medium is absolutely a must have for me. Great stories, and I was very impressed with the privacy policy and terms of service, not many people these days read these policies and some companies absolutely do not have any of your interests in mind at all. Medium truly seems to be focused on providing a good service, for a good price, that really does benefit the user. Thank you Medium! Amazing!",2
I love the app because it helps me continue to read the quality articles and lets me do it at where I left off,2
"Many excellent articles catered to you specific taste, definitely a the must have news app",2
"The is a great app when you are without your main pc or a laptop. You can view articles and add the to view later, this is handy whenever you want to type a comment and are not great at typing on a tablet.",2
Very easy to use and I appreciate the recommendations and notifications for my daily reads. Suggestion would be to save searched terms to search for them again more easily. Have not been displeased with any articles recommended to me.,2
Paid version is better......get to read tons of variety of articles,2
Let's talk about a place where you can read and learn. Let's say a Library where you're allowed to speak but no voice distracts you. That is Medium. Well that's how I use it. From writing and reading articles about Relationships to Programming. This is one of the best platforms for these.,2

It's very difficult not to like it!",2
Awesome! I absolutely love the vast array of subjects and content and all of the passionate and engaging authors!!,2
"Very good app, but hope the iformation you provide is trusted, and usefull to life.",2
Awesome app. Very clear in nature..,2
Excellent app.Having an amazing experience learning,2
I love reading the articles in Medium. Some of the articles have taught me about things I have never even considered. Its almost like I am having great conversations with a new friend. This is my favorite app to go to when I want to learn and relax.,2
My experience has been wonderful. Love the app. I particularly like the fact that i can read articles i saved offline,2
I love the reading experience in this app. Nothing better,2
Easy to learn and the articles are good,2
"By readers, for readers. If you love to read about subjects that interest you without annoying ads then Medium is a great app and service. As you use it I find the recommendations are right on point and it also tells you the size of an article beforehand so you can judge whether or not you have time for a quick diversion vs. a deeper dive. Love it.",2
"I love Medium, great thought-provoking writers serving up interesting content everyday. The app makes it easy I saved my favorites you can also applaud the authors that you like and they get extra compensation I believe I just find it even better than the news.",2
So far extremely informative and seemingly little bias.,2
I've enjoyed using medium thus far. It gives me the change to read great articles and then if you sign up for the partner program it gives you the opportunity to write articles and feel like a published journalist as well. As far as the program I haven't seen any profit off the WONDERFUL (lol) articles I have written - but I am keeping hope alive! Be sure to check me out on Medium at WayneDaStar,2
"So many times something sounds interesting, but when I start to read it I'm irritated because it wasted my time as well as really not being what was advertised. I don't think that has ever happened on Medium. Everything I ever read on Medium seems authentic, concise, appropriate (I am pretty picky about what I choose to read, so that could be a factor) useful, interesting and applicable.",2
Love the articles and writing on Medium,2
"Great articles, love it!",2
I love to read interesting things. This is a good medium for that. 🤪👍,2
Love Medium! App is functional and easy to use. Just wish you could have more than 3 free articles a month. Update on 7/06/20: I was given a month free trial and have to say I'll be subscribing when it's over. There is really some incredibly talented people writing on this website! It'll be well worth the monthly cost.,2
It's easy to access and expressive. I love to use it during leisure. Thanks Medium Team.,2
"Fascinating stories from real life, so much better than reading the newspapers",2
Excellent app for articles about any artists. Each article is very clear and informative. I wish it had ad revenue model. I know that it would damage the clean ux. reduce the prices if you could.,2

I've been reading a lot of personal growth articles now and I actually feel like it's helping me figure out the person I want to be, and pursue it.",2
"I really like the app and use it daily. One thing that could be improved though is subscribing to subtopics and not only to topics. Also blacklisting on topic and sub topic, and writer level would be useful. My wife read one article about beauty care and every second day I am getting something related in my daily feed, even after discarding these articles every single time.",2
Great content published and pushed down,2
"I have read some amazing easy to navigate articles. It's an amazing app, especially the fact that every article has an approximated time you could spend reading it",2

"Medium has an eclectic mix of articles. Always interesting & timely. Because so many sources are represented, I don't have to subscribe to as many pubs to get good journalism. The ""save to reading list"" is useful. It's also easy to focus on topics or writers of particular interest.",2
"I just singed up for my free trial because I have actually found this application very useful. I am a student, who is always looking for useful insight on anything that I can apply to my life. Medium seems to be the source I was looking for when it comes to useful information tailored to my needs. I enjoy how the application is set up, because it is very easy to save articles for future reading as well as follow authors that I enjoy.",2
It's amazing here...but I struggle to publish in publication via this,2

Great application to read about everything 😃😊,2

"If you are a writer looking for your voice to be heard or to tell stories about how the every day affects your life as a whole, medium is that platform. Like a friend of mine describes it, medium is Instagram for writers and I'd go further to say medium is more interesting than the latter.",2
Great app to get valuable information.,2
"Always been a computer screen reader of Medium, but this app has me converted to mobile and I'm reading more now and saving less for later that I usually don't get around to. Would be nice to save reading list into categories, more for favorite things, but maybe I haven't figured it out yet.",2
Great app. Medium has its user friendly minimalistic interface for readers as there are no annoying ads. These features increase the readability of articles. You'll have to just subscribe to its subscription plan for full access that is affordable and very cheap. 👍 thanks medium,2

At first I thought that this will be another app that just takes up space but this app is a keeper if you're looking for a one stop shop for information packed articles and a plethora of engaging writers. A must have.,2
"I'm really surprised that a site is genuinely ad-free in this society. I am aware that you can only read 3 articles without a membership, but considering your only paying $5 a month, I don't see why that can be a problem. Saving up 5 bucks monthly is no problem at all, and that's coming from a highschooler in a ""3rd world country"". Overall, the site is inspiring, the people are amazing and the app works wonderfully. Completely worth it.",2
